Ensure<br/>you're producing enough to sustain it.\n\nFor recipes without a catalyst,<br/>you must specify the catalyst in the GUI by right-clicking the Convergence<br/>button, otherwise it will default to Crude.[/note]\n\n[note]Math for the<br/>curious:\n\nTo clear up what exactly happens in the background, here's an<br/>explanation on how the extra catalyst values are calculated using an example:\n\nThe<br/>example recipe of choice is the molten neutronium recipe using prosaic<br/>catalyst, running at 64A UMV (8,589,934,592 EU/t).\nThe recipe uses 14,753L<br/>of Prosaic catalyst and 36,484,545,600 EU per recipe without OCs or the<br/>catalyst discount. With the discount, the catalyst amount gets cut in half,<br/>meaning 7,376.5L of catalyst, which are rounded to 7,376L, and due to the<br/>64A UMV the machine is supplied with the recipe overclocks 3 times, meaning<br/>each recipe actually uses 36,484,545,600 * 2^3 = 291,876,364,800 EU. \n\nKnowing<br/>the amount of OCs and the base voltage of the recipe, the difference of<br/>the needed EU per recipe with and without perfect OC can be calculated,<br/>that being 291,876,364,800 - 36,484,545,600 = 255,391,819,200 extra EU<br/>due to imperfect OCs.\nTo get the value of needed extra catalyst, this extra<br/>EU value has to be divided by the energy density of the relevant catalyst,<br/>prosaic in this case.\n\nThe division equates to 255,391,819,200 EU / 66,768,460<br/>EU/L = 3,825.037 L, rounded to 3,825L extra prosaic catalyst per recipe.<br/>For the final step, this value has to be multiplied by 0.5 as its affected<br/>by the discount, meaning the total extra catalyst that gets added to the<br/>recipe is 3,825L * 0.5 = 1,912.5 L, rounded to 1,912L.\n\nTo summarise it<br/>all in a formula:\nAmount extra catalyst per recipe = (B * ((2^x) - 1))/2L\nwhere:\nB<br/>is base total EU of the recipe\nx is the number of overclocks\nL is the EU/L<br/>of the relevant catalyst [/note]\n<br/>"
