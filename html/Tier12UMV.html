To achieve this, you need a full discount,<br/>and the extra power cost is offset by using more of<br/>the same catalyst.\n\nOverall, it is more efficient and<br/>totally worth it.\n\nThis process is extremely catalyst-hungry.<br/>Ensure you're producing enough to sustain it.\n\nFor<br/>recipes without a catalyst, you must specify the catalyst<br/>in the GUI by right-clicking the Convergence button,<br/>otherwise it will default to Crude.[/note]\n\n[note]Math<br/>for the curious:\n\nTo clear up what exactly happens<br/>in the background, here's an explanation on how the<br/>extra catalyst values are calculated using an example:\n\nThe<br/>example recipe of choice is the molten neutronium recipe<br/>using prosaic catalyst, running at 64A UMV (8,589,934,592<br/>EU/t).\nThe recipe uses 14,753L of Prosaic catalyst<br/>and 36,484,545,600 EU per recipe without OCs or the<br/>catalyst discount. With the discount, the catalyst<br/>amount gets cut in half, meaning 7,376.5\u00a7 L of catalyst,<br/>which are rounded to 7,376L, and due to the 64A UMV<br/>the machine is supplied with the recipe overclocks<br/>3 times, meaning each recipe actually uses 36,484,545,600<br/>* 2^3 = 291,876,364,800 EU. \n\nKnowing the amount of<br/>OCs and the base voltage of the recipe, the difference<br/>of the needed EU per recipe with and without perfect<br/>OC can be calculated, that being 291,876,364,800 -<br/>36,484,545,600 = 255,391,819,200 extra EU due to imperfect<br/>OCs.\nTo get the value of needed extra catalyst, this<br/>extra EU value has to be divided by the energy density<br/>of the relevant catalyst, prosaic in this case.\n\nThe<br/>division equates to 255,391,819,200 EU / 66,768,460<br/>EU/L = 3,825.037 L, rounded to 3,825L extra prosaic<br/>catalyst per recipe. For the final step, this value<br/>has to be multiplied by 0.5 as its affected by the<br/>discount, meaning the total extra catalyst that gets<br/>added to the recipe is 3,825L * 0.5 = 1,912.5 L, rounded<br/>to 1,912L.\n\nTo summarise it all in a formula:\nAmount<br/>extra catalyst per recipe = (B * ((2^x) - 1))/2L\nwhere:\nB<br/>is base total EU of the recipe\nx is the number of overclocks\nL<br/>is the EU/L of the relevant catalyst [/note]\n<br/><br/><br/>"
