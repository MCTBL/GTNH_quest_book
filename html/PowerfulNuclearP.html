However, it comes in all shapes<br/>and forms, and it can be hard to choose one kind of setup to use amongst<br/>all of those that are available. To start this questbook page, this first<br/>quest will be a summary of how nuclear power can be produced, and when<br/>it is available. Other quests down the line will have more details about<br/>each specific setup, but this is an overview of all of them.\n\nTL;DR: Nuke<br/>< Fluid Nuke < Vacuum Nuke < LFTR = THTR = Naq Reactor < Fusion < Compact<br/>Fusion for power, per reactor. For breeding, Nuke < LFTR = Naq Reactor<br/>< HTGR in terms of breeding speed and outputs, with fusion being required<br/>to make some materials.\n\nThe first nuclear source you have access to is<br/>the Industrialcraft 2 Nuclear Reactor, usually called a nuke. It's a small<br/>singleblock that can have additional chambers attached to it to make a<br/>multiblock structure, and the amount of chambers decides the amount of<br/>space available for the nuke's components. Inside it, fuel rods with radioactive<br/>materials generate power, and every other item serves to control the temperature<br/>of the reactor and keep it from exploding. It generates EU directly, but<br/>it can be upgraded to a fluid nuke, which outputs hot coolant instead,<br/>for the Large Heat Exchanger, but with more efficiency. Lastly, there's<br/>also the vacuum nuke, which is very similar to regular nukes but it cools<br/>down by using Coolant Cells, which wear out and are only reusable by using<br/>Vacuum Freezers. Usual fuels for all of these are Thorium, in EV, and Uranium,<br/>in IV.\n\nBetween IV and LuV, there's another kind of reactor, the Liquid<br/>Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR). In this large multi, the Thorium and Uranium<br/>are mixed with very hot, molten salts (which need to be prepared in another<br/>multi), improving the power generation at the cost of additional processing.<br/>It's an expensive setup, but the depleted fuel can be recycled into many<br/>more byproducts than usual, especially at LuV, where you can get almost<br/>all the noble gases amongst other things, alongside huge amounts of power.\n\nAt<br/>those same tiers (albeit mostly for LuV and above), there are also two<br/>larger multis, the Thorium High Temperature Reactor (THTR) and the High<br/>Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR). The THTR is mostly for power, needing<br/>an input of about 0.5 IV amps and outputting LuV power at a varied amount<br/>of amps, whereas the HTGR is a breeder reactor, outputting 1/20 the amount<br/>of hot coolant, which is where the power generation comes from, but with<br/>much better ratios for breeding into Lutetium and other elements.\n\nAnother<br/>kind of nuclear reactor is the Good Generators Naquadah Reactor, which<br/>coincidentally has recipes to consume Thorium Liquid Fuel and Uranium Liquid<br/>Fuel, alongside the several types of Naquadah fuel that exist. With these<br/>two, this reactor can process those elements much faster than regular nukes,<br/>which is helpful for power and for breeding, but it requires more processing<br/>until those fuels are ready to be consumed. Additionally, there are fuel<br/>rods for the IC2 nukes that use different Thorium and Uranium fuels, more<br/>or less related to these. \n\nFrom then on, it's fusion power. The infamous<br/>GregTech Fusion Reactors work by fusing two elements into a new one, which<br/>is often a required step for progression, but they also turn the power<br/>they require into exponentially more in the way of plasma. Helium and Tin<br/>Plasma are some of the most used for power, and putting them into Plasma<br/>Turbines is an excellent source of power for lategame, in ZPM to UEV and<br/>so on. There are 4 tiers to the regular Fusion Reactors, but there is also<br/>compact fusion and some other kinks to fusion that you might explore later<br/>on.\n\nThis page will mostly serve to guide you into making a choice between<br/>all of these possibilities. It's pretty much guaranteed that you'll use<br/>at least 2-3 of these setups, so try to get comfortable with these quest<br/>descriptions.<br/><br/>"

These are the two main components of the previous solders,<br/>and that's the reason they're needed now. Tin Plasma is t2 fusion, and<br/>you might have already made a lot of it to generate power, but Bismuth<br/>Plasma is t3, with the inputs being Zinc Plasma and Molten Tantalum, which<br/>is actually Tritium, Copper and Tantalum in the end. \n\nThe recipes are<br/>cheap in power, you just have to make sure the inputs are there. Tritium<br/>can be centrifuged from Deuterium, which itself can be centrifuged from<br/>Hydrogen Gas, and the other two inputs are easy.

Uranium is the main upgrade to Thorium in nukes, with a lot more<br/>power to give and a different useful breeding byproduct, but you need about<br/>3 stacks of Uranium 238 to set up the most powerful basic IC2 Uranium Nuke.\n\nHow<br/>do you get it, though? The one answer is, you get it from Thorium. Looking<br/>at NEI, the Thorium ore processing has a chance to give Uranium dusts,<br/>which you can use as fuel, but this happens very slowly, especially considering<br/>that Thorium is a rare ore in the Nether, even if each ore block gives<br/>4 crushed dust. The reality seems to be that fast Uranium only happens<br/>when you can mine from t2 planets, but this is not the only way. There<br/>is a secret, and this secret involves IC2 crops.\n\nHow does it work? Well,<br/>it's simple. The IC2 crop that corresponds to Thorium, the God of Thunder,<br/>can quadruple each Crushed Thorium Ore into 4 Purified Thorium Ore, but<br/>it also outputs, in fluid form, one Uranium Ingot! This means that each<br/>Thorium Ore gives you 4 Uranium Ingots, and with around 42 ore, you can<br/>do one cycle of that big reactor setup. God of Thunder needs the ore under<br/>it, though, so make sure you save some for that purpose.\n\nEV Uranium nukes<br/>are a achievement intended mostly for IC2 crop users, so this quest won't<br/>demand something like that. Still, it's a useful secret, so here it is.<br/>Additionally, the Uranium crop quest in the questbook awards you with 32<br/>Pitchblende when you complete it, which might prove useful for both for<br/>quadrupling Uranium and getting Radium for Radon!"

It collides single particles with one another,<br/>or against fluids, to generate new items while consuming power. Most of<br/>the recipes it has won't be very useful, if at all, but it can also make<br/>Quantum Anomalies. This is a chance craft, but the Anomaly has a special<br/>property: when used to convert some blocks to others, it will not be consumed.<br/>Therefore, for that purpose, you only need to get one.\n\nIs this required?<br/>Well, yes. When you arrive at a certain stage of the game, you might find<br/>yourself needing a new kind of soldering alloy, called Mutated Living Solder.<br/>To craft this, you need a Chemical Plant made with Botmium, which is an<br/>alloy that required Advanced Nitinol.

It<br/>is possible to find it in ores, but even the most complicated magic rituals<br/>to get them need some Europium to start, which leaves fusion crafting as<br/>the most reliable option to automate the entire process. It is a slow craft,<br/>but not an expensive one provided you already have the reactor built, since<br/>it uses cheap materials as inputs: Hydrogen and Neodymium. Both of these<br/>were used extensively for progression, so you should not have any trouble<br/>grabbing several hundreds of each to start this reaction.\n\nIt is important<br/>that you gather a lot of inputs. Each time the Fusion Reactor changes recipe,<br/>it has a start-up period where it needs a large amount of energy to begin<br/>crafting. In the case of Europium, you'll need 150 million EU to start<br/>crafting it, and then 7,077,888 EU per ingot of Europium crafted. This<br/>does not come out as plasma, so you can't get energy back from it! Additionally,<br/>each ingot takes 14.4 seconds to craft, so you can come out with a few<br/>stacks of Europium relatively quickly. During this time, you cannot produce<br/>plasma for power, so it's a good idea to have a good amount of EU stored,<br/>or other powergen setups working in the background, while you craft this<br/>material.\n\nWith Europium, you can craft a new kind of boule, wafers and<br/>many other things!

The molten salt is designed to flow downwards into a hole where<br/>it solidifies, in case the reactor has problems, so it's impossible for<br/>the fission process to continue into an explosive mess.\n\nThere are three<br/>downsides, though. One of them was mentioned just above, the fuel needs<br/>more processing to be ready for the LFTR, and more input materials to reach<br/>the right mixture. After it goes through the reactor, it comes out as depleted,<br/>and this part too requires more processing steps, although it gives out<br/>a lot more useful chemicals than the single Lutetium/Plutonium the IC2<br/>nuke depletion process gave. Lastly, the molten salt is very hot and very<br/>corrosive, which means it would destroy the materials used to build the<br/>IC2 nukes. You will need newer, stronger and more expensive materials to<br/>build a reactor, not to mention its much larger size. \n\nThe structure for<br/>this multi is truly something else. It has not one, but four required Dynamo<br/>Hatches, which should all be the Buffered type, either EV, IV or LuV depending<br/>on the fuel being fed into the reactor, with better fuels being unlocked<br/>at later progression stages. This means that one LFTR makes either 1 LuV<br/>amp, 1 ZPM amp or 1 UV amp while running. It also requires 2 Maintenance<br/>and 4 Muffler Hatches, when it has no maintenance problems or pollution<br/>output! Mysterious are the workings of this reactor.\n\nOther than this,<br/>all the inputs and outputs are fluids. The minimum amount you'll need is<br/>2 inputs and 4 outputs, although one of the outputs comes out over time,<br/>and not on recipe finish.

If you haven't set up Helium<br/>Sparge Towers yet, do so now.\n\nWhen you do this, you can grab the two Fuel<br/>Refineries you should have and set them both to the 2-input recipe. Each<br/>bucket of Fuel 3 takes 9000 seconds to make, but is consumed in 4000 seconds,<br/>so it's good to have more than one Refinery per LFTR. With this, you will<br/>make fuel much faster, and generate much more EU than before. If you continue<br/>expanding, it's very possible to match the first tiers of fusion power<br/>from something like this."

MOX.\n\nMOX means<br/>mixed-oxide, which is the name given to the mix of Uranium and Plutonium.<br/>In here, rods with this fuel are special in the sense that they don't output<br/>a specific amount of EU/t from the usual nuke mechanics.

This imposes an obvious problem - hot reactors are not good for<br/>your base.\n\nThere is one standardized way of dealing with this: heat-neutral<br/>reactors. What this means is that the reactor's temperature does not change<br/>while it's active, because the components inside are not interacting with<br/>the reactor's temperature value, only with the value of other components<br/>like the fuel rods themselves.

It follows the same principle<br/>as the LFTR, use a new processing chain to turn Thorium, Uranium and Plutonium<br/>into liquid fuels, very dense with energy, which are then slowly burned<br/>to generate large amounts of power over a very long period of time. This<br/>reactor, for example, burns its fuels 1 milibucket at a time, over several<br/>seconds, when running without additives, a very slow burner by default.\n\nLet's<br/>look at the NEI recipes. Excited Thorium outputs 2,200 EU/t, Excited Uranium<br/>outputs 12,960 EU/t and Excited Plutonium outputs 32,400 EU/t. These are<br/>small numbers, clearly, so this can't possibly be the most powerful nuclear<br/>fission reactor. However, this multi is more complicated than that! In<br/>total, there are 4 inputs you can provide for it: one of them is the required<br/>fuel and another is the also required Liquid Air to generate EU from that<br/>fuel, but the other 2 are additives that are optional, yet increase both<br/>the efficiency and the consumption speed of the fuel.

The other casings are similar to<br/>what you've made before, and the tooltip gives a good description of what<br/>exactly is needed to build the Fuel Refinery. \n\nWhere to put each casing?<br/>The bottom two layers are 3x3, and they take the Structural Blocks. On<br/>top of the second layer, in the middle block, make a tower of 5 Fluid Containment<br/>Blocks, and then cover these with Sealant Blocks, like you would do in<br/>a Multiblock Miner. However, the second layer of the 5, from the bottom,<br/>uses Reactor Shielding Blocks, 4 of them there instead of the Sealant Blocks.<br/>Use the Hologram Projector for assistance if you're having trouble.\n\nWhen<br/>it's fully built, you can focus on the recipes. Out of the 5 that are available,<br/>you can only do one at this time, the Fuel 1 recipe. To make this fuel,<br/>you need molten U235, but also Lithium Fluoride, Beryllium Fluoride and<br/>Zirconium Tetrafluoride.

However, the LFTR fuels are also very, very<br/>energy dense, so each bucket of Fluorine can bring you a long way.\n\nIf<br/>you're looking through NEI, your first response might be \"There are no<br/>recipes for these fluorides other than reprocessing the depleted fuels!<br/>How am I supposed to make these?\". The answer is in the dusts: you have<br/>to craft the dusts and then fluid extract them into the fluids.

Besides, this first fuel is just a stepping<br/>stone, so don't worry about fully automating everything just yet, the final<br/>setup is different from this one.<br/><br/>"

The coolants boost fuel efficiency, which<br/>means fuel consumption is the same, whereas the boosters increase the speed<br/>the multi burns the fuel, increasing the output at the same time.\n\nThere<br/>are three coolants, but the 275% efficiency boost by using Cryotheum should<br/>not be ignored. To automate it, you will need an automated source of Blaze<br/>Rods and Snowballs (Snow is made from Water). To this, you add Redstone<br/>and Saltpeter, and you're done.\n\nThe boosters are more difficult to choose<br/>from. Caesium should be ignored, Uranium 235 can be automated from Uranium<br/>238 with magic at an almost 1:1 ratio, but Naquadah is what you probably<br/>have ready to use for this, which quadruples the speed of this reactor.<br/>However, if this is too slow, you can instead automate Atomic Separation<br/>Catalyst to get a 16x speed boost! There are many recipes for this, so<br/>choose your favorite."

The different conversion from fuel to energy between fluid<br/>and vacuum means that Thorium is very good for fluid nukes, whereas Uranium<br/>is very good for vacuum nukes."

Before doing that, though, it's a good<br/>idea to step back and test your turbines with this plasma, preferably in<br/>Creative mode, because the fuel value is so high that one liter of plasma<br/>is worth 150,000 EU at 100% efficiency.

The biggest setup<br/>you can put together for a single IC2 Nuclear Reactor uses 7 Quad Uranium<br/>Rods, or 28 single rods.

The setup is very similar to the previous<br/>one, but with some important differences. What are they?\n\nThe first one<br/>is the fuel. These fuel rods use a mixture of U238 and a bit of U235, which<br/>is rarer. To get U235, you can gamble on the chance of getting the dust<br/>from processing some of the related ores, which might be good enough, but<br/>it's also possible to use Thaumcraft to convert 9 nuggets of U238 to 7<br/>nuggets of U235, without needing a lot of Thaumcraft progress. Assembling<br/>this fuel and putting it into rods gets it ready to be used for power,<br/>with more EU/t but less burn time compared to Thorium, 50000 seconds for<br/>Thorium compared to 20000 seconds for Uranium.\n\nThe second difference in<br/>the nuke setup. Uranium eats up more per rod, so a different arrangement<br/>inside the nuke is required. For the highest EU/t in this situation, 4200<br/>EU/t, the setup is:\n\nRVOEOOVOP\nPVOOVOORO\nPOROOROOV\nVOOVOOVOP\nOROOROORO\nPOVPOVPOV\n\nE<br/>-> Component Heat Exchanger (1 needed)\nV -> Component Heat Vent (11 needed)\nO<br/>-> Overclocked Heat Vent (28 needed)\nR -> Quad Fuel Rod of Uranium (7 needed)\nP<br/>-> Reactor Plating (7 needed)\n\nWhen the fuel rods get repleted, you can<br/>reprocess them to get 3/4 of the U235 back, and also a bit of Plutonium.<br/>"

It's very risky to do it in servers with no backups,<br/>because it relies on redstone circuits to keep the reactor from exploding.<br/>Use multiple failsafes to guarantee safety. Never ever build a vacuum nuke<br/>in a Thermos server!\n\nVacuum nukes are an interesting GTNH-specific setup.<br/>They use only three components: fuel rods, platings to fill the empty slots<br/>for automation purposes, and coolant cells. Those cells you have used to<br/>make Energy Hatches, for example, they're used here to keep the reactor<br/>from overheating and exploding. The main difference this setup has is that<br/>these cells are consumable, and will wear out over time. You will need<br/>to add fresh cells into the reactor to keep running it safely, but the<br/>crux of the show is that you don't need to make new ones - you just need<br/>to cool them down again.\n\nThe Vacuum Freezer! That's why it's called a<br/>vacuum nuke! Elementary, my dear Steve. This kind of setup relies on using<br/>EU to refill the coolant cells, so to speak, and get much more EU from<br/>the reactor than you spend to keep it running. However, the redstone automation<br/>for this is quite tricky. If you just try it blindly, it might take you<br/>a long time to figure it out, and it might have explosive results. Check<br/>the Vacuum Reactors page on the wiki ([url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Vacuum_Reactors[/url])<br/>if you want a detailed guide that goes far beyond what I could write in<br/>this quest description.\n\nThis quest task is for the last setup shown in<br/>the wiki, specifically the 8720-43600 EU, 40 Quad Uranium setup. As the<br/>title implies, it can produce up to 43600 EU/t, but it will require multiple<br/>filters and failsafes to run it safely.
