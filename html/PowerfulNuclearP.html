However, it<br/>comes in all shapes and forms, and it can be hard to<br/>choose one kind of setup to use amongst all of those<br/>that are available. To start this questbook page, this<br/>first quest will be a summary of how nuclear power<br/>can be produced, and when it is available. Other quests<br/>down the line will have more details about each specific<br/>setup, but this is an overview of all of them.\n\nTL;DR:<br/>Nuke < Fluid Nuke < Vacuum Nuke < LFTR = THTR = Naq<br/>Reactor < Fusion < Compact Fusion for power, per reactor.<br/>For breeding, Nuke < LFTR = Naq Reactor < HTGR in terms<br/>of breeding speed and outputs, with fusion being required<br/>to make some materials.\n\nThe first nuclear source you<br/>have access to is the Industrialcraft 2 Nuclear Reactor,<br/>usually called a nuke. It's a small singleblock that<br/>can have additional chambers attached to it to make<br/>a multiblock structure, and the amount of chambers<br/>decides the amount of space available for the nuke's<br/>components. Inside it, fuel rods with radioactive materials<br/>generate power, and every other item serves to control<br/>the temperature of the reactor and keep it from exploding.<br/>It generates EU directly, but it can be upgraded to<br/>a fluid nuke, which outputs hot coolant instead, for<br/>the Large Heat Exchanger, but with more efficiency.<br/>Lastly, there's also the vacuum nuke, which is very<br/>similar to regular nukes but it cools down by using<br/>Coolant Cells, which wear out and are only reusable<br/>by using Vacuum Freezers. Usual fuels for all of these<br/>are Thorium, in EV, and Uranium, in IV.\n\nBetween IV<br/>and LuV, there's another kind of reactor, the Liquid<br/>Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR). In this large multi,<br/>the Thorium and Uranium are mixed with very hot, molten<br/>salts (which need to be prepared in another multi),<br/>improving the power generation at the cost of additional<br/>processing. It's an expensive setup, but the depleted<br/>fuel can be recycled into many more byproducts than<br/>usual, especially at LuV, where you can get almost<br/>all the noble gases amongst other things, alongside<br/>huge amounts of power.\n\nAt those same tiers (albeit<br/>mostly for LuV and above), there are also two larger<br/>multis, the Thorium High Temperature Reactor (THTR)<br/>and the High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR).<br/>The THTR is mostly for power, needing an input of about<br/>0.5 IV amps and outputting LuV power at a varied amount<br/>of amps, whereas the HTGR is a breeder reactor, outputting<br/>1/20 the amount of hot coolant, which is where the<br/>power generation comes from, but with much better ratios<br/>for breeding into Lutetium and other elements.\n\nAnother<br/>kind of nuclear reactor is the Good Generators Naquadah<br/>Reactor, which coincidentally has recipes to consume<br/>Thorium Liquid Fuel and Uranium Liquid Fuel, alongside<br/>the several types of Naquadah fuel that exist. With<br/>these two, this reactor can process those elements<br/>much faster than regular nukes, which is helpful for<br/>power and for breeding, but it requires more processing<br/>until those fuels are ready to be consumed. Additionally,<br/>there are fuel rods for the IC2 nukes that use different<br/>Thorium and Uranium fuels, more or less related to<br/>these. \n\nFrom then on, it's fusion power. The infamous<br/>GregTech Fusion Reactors work by fusing two elements<br/>into a new one, which is often a required step for<br/>progression, but they also turn the power they require<br/>into exponentially more in the way of plasma. Helium<br/>and Tin Plasma are some of the most used for power,<br/>and putting them into Plasma Turbines is an excellent<br/>source of power for lategame, in ZPM to UEV and so<br/>on. There are 4 tiers to the regular Fusion Reactors,<br/>but there is also compact fusion and some other kinks<br/>to fusion that you might explore later on.\n\nThis page<br/>will mostly serve to guide you into making a choice<br/>between all of these possibilities. It's pretty much<br/>guaranteed that you'll use at least 2-3 of these setups,<br/>so try to get comfortable with these quest descriptions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

In fact, you can get it much earlier<br/>than EV, but the speed at which you get it can vary<br/>wildly, depending on how you approach this problem.<br/>Uranium is the main upgrade to Thorium in nukes, with<br/>a lot more power to give and a different useful breeding<br/>byproduct, but you need about 3 stacks of Uranium 238<br/>to set up the most powerful basic IC2 Uranium Nuke.\n\nHow<br/>do you get it, though? The one answer is, you get it<br/>from Thorium. Looking at NEI, the Thorium ore processing<br/>has a chance to give Uranium dusts, which you can use<br/>as fuel, but this happens very slowly, especially considering<br/>that Thorium is a rare ore in the Nether, even if each<br/>ore block gives 4 crushed dust. The reality seems to<br/>be that fast Uranium only happens when you can mine<br/>from t2 planets, but this is not the only way. There<br/>is a secret, and this secret involves IC2 crops.\n\nHow<br/>does it work? Well, it's simple. The IC2 crop that<br/>corresponds to Thorium, the God of Thunder, can quadruple<br/>each Crushed Thorium Ore into 4 Purified Thorium Ore,<br/>but it also outputs, in fluid form, one Uranium Ingot!<br/>This means that each Thorium Ore gives you 4 Uranium<br/>Ingots, and with around 42 ore, you can do one cycle<br/>of that big reactor setup. God of Thunder needs the<br/>ore under it, though, so make sure you save some for<br/>that purpose.\n\nEV Uranium nukes are a achievement intended<br/>mostly for IC2 crop users, so this quest won't demand<br/>something like that. Still, it's a useful secret, so<br/>here it is. Additionally, the Uranium crop quest in<br/>the questbook awards you with 32 Pitchblende when you<br/>complete it, which might prove useful for both for<br/>quadrupling Uranium and getting Radium for Radon!<br/><br/>"

That is a multiblock that works<br/>a bit like fusion, but only for the purpose of making<br/>new materials. It collides single particles with one<br/>another, or against fluids, to generate new items while<br/>consuming power. Most of the recipes it has won't be<br/>very useful, if at all, but it can also make Quantum<br/>Anomalies. This is a chance craft, but the Anomaly<br/>has a special property: when used to convert some blocks<br/>to others, it will not be consumed. Therefore, for<br/>that purpose, you only need to get one.\n\nIs this required?<br/>Well, yes. When you arrive at a certain stage of the<br/>game, you might find yourself needing a new kind of<br/>soldering alloy, called Mutated Living Solder. To craft<br/>this, you need a Chemical Plant made with Botmium,<br/>which is an alloy that required Advanced Nitinol.

What kind of setup is powerful<br/>enough to output several IV amps, and sustain a developed<br/>IV base on its own? That sort of setup is shown in<br/>this quest, but it requires more multiblocks, and therefore<br/>more expense than the previous quest's chain. The fuel<br/>is the same, Uranium, so at this point it's certainly<br/>the least of your worries, until you try to automate<br/>the fuel input, at least.\n\nThe components inside the<br/>nuke get more and more complicated, so at this point<br/>I'm going to ask you to look at the wiki, under the<br/>Nuclear Reactors page ([url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Nuclear_Reactors[/url]),<br/>and scroll down to the fluid nuke setups, specifically<br/>the 1352 HU, 2 Quad Uranium and 1408, 3 Quad Uranium,<br/>1 Dual Uranium ones. The main difference between these<br/>two setups is that the first needs Iridium Neutron<br/>Reflectors, which are quite expensive if you haven't<br/>done the platline yet, while the second doesn't use<br/>them but is harder to automate due to having more than<br/>one type of rod.\n\nWhat's the final EU/t output, at<br/>170% turbine efficiency? 36288 and 38016 EU/t, respectively.\n\nAfter<br/>automating the nuke itself, there is still more to<br/>do, though. The LHE is required, as usual, but these<br/>setups cause something new to happen: the LHE starts<br/>outputting Superheated Steam, due to the high flow<br/>of hot coolant that it receives, which means that you<br/>need two sets of turbines instead of one. This type<br/>of steam must go into Large HP Steam Turbines, which<br/>use a good amount of Tungstensteel for the controller<br/>and stacks of Titanium for the casings. After those,<br/>it goes into the usual Large Steam Turbines, and the<br/>process is complete.\n\nThere is yet another new thing<br/>to worry about, in case all of this wasn't enough:<br/>the Steam flow is very high, higher than before, which<br/>means it's likely you will need 3 or more of each turbine<br/>type, further compounding on the costs you'll have<br/>here. \n\nYour best option for a turbine in the IV tier<br/>is the HSS-E at 170% turbine efficiency. \n\nThere is<br/>another turbine at 180% efficiency with the HSS-S however;<br/>this turbine requires a robust platinium line completed<br/>to spare the resources for it.<br/><br/><br/>"

That's why it's called<br/>a vacuum nuke! Elementary, my dear Steve. This kind<br/>of setup relies on using EU to refill the coolant cells,<br/>so to speak, and get much more EU from the reactor<br/>than you spend to keep it running.
