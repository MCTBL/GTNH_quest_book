There are a few<br/>things you need to understand before using one.\n\n\u00a7lCONSTRUCTION\u00a7r.<br/>Much like an assembly line, the QC is built as a series<br/>of slices. The first and last slice are the only valid<br/>locations for hatches. The slices in between are primarily<br/>for computer racks. The Multiblock Structure Hologram<br/>Projector shows the minimum length QC, but holding<br/>multiple in a single stack will show/build longer versions<br/>up to the maximum length of 16. There is also a mandatory<br/>air block in front of the computer heat vents.\n\n\u00a7lOUTPUT\u00a7r.<br/>Computation is nothing more than an integer input for<br/>certain recipes--much like EU. There may exist a minimum<br/>throughput requirement, a threshold to reach, or both<br/>(NEI will tell you everything). Computation is generated<br/>every second by the QC, transmitted by an Optical Transmission<br/>Connector, received by an Optical Reception Connector,<br/>and \"consumed\" by the machine or process that needs<br/>it. There is no storing computation and there can only<br/>be ONE transmission or reception hatch connected to<br/>the same Optical Fiber Cables at a time. If absolutely<br/>necessary, the Network Switch with QOS can split/join<br/>connections but know that it takes both power and maintenance<br/>to run.\n\nAdditional QC can be chained together using<br/>another set of Optical Transmission and Optical Reception<br/>Connectors between machines, but they cannot wallshare<br/>the same Optical Transmission Connector.\n\n\u00a7lUNCERTAINTY\u00a7r.<br/>The QC has a unique maintenance requirement that can<br/>only be corrected by balancing the Schr\u00f6dinger Matrix<br/>inside an Uncertainty Resolver--an additional hatch<br/>that must go on either the first or last slice of the<br/>machine. Start with the basic Uncertainty Resolver,<br/>but know that there are two more tiers unlocked later<br/>on that lower the difficulty of the puzzle, or not?\n\nThe<br/>interface of the Uncertainty Resolver has the Schr\u00f6dinger<br/>Matrix in the middle and two sets of 8 buttons on the<br/>left and right. Clicking on one button and then another<br/>will switch the states of the two corresponding cells<br/>in the matrix. This means switching their blinking<br/>speed (in the basic Uncertainty Resolver) or their<br/>shade/color (in the Uncertainty Resolver X). The goal<br/>of the puzzle is to balance the states of the matrix<br/>around the glowing LED lights, turning all of them<br/>green.\n\n\u00a7lPARAMETERS\u00a7r. In the GUI of the controller,<br/>there are two configurable parameters, overclock and<br/>overvolt, that change how computation and heat are<br/>generated. Higher overclock values contribute the most<br/>to computation and higher overvolt values contribute<br/>the most to heat. Alone, this would encourage the player<br/>to make overclock as high as possible and overvolt<br/>as low as possible, but there is a penalty to computation<br/>for large differences between these two parameters.<br/>Furthermore, overvolt values <1 will cause the QC to<br/>randomly drop computation proportional to its distance<br/>from 1. It is highly encouraged to play around with<br/>these parameters, as all the best setups do.\n\nSee the<br/>adjacent quest for more information on computer racks<br/>and generating computation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Every rack is also completely<br/>independent from every other rack which means it is<br/>not possible to have one rack with all circuits and<br/>another with all vents.\n\nThe computation of a rack<br/>is the sum of all the components' individual computation.<br/>For example, two APU (Tier 3) and two Cooling Cores<br/>have 240 + 240 + 0 + 0 = 480 base computation per second.<br/>However, computation changes significantly depending<br/>on the values for overclock and overvolt:\n\n[note]Computation<br/>= Base * (1+overclock^2) / (1+(overclock-overvolt)^2)[/note]\n\nThe<br/>heat of a rack is a value between 0 and 10,000 and<br/>is reported in the interface of the QC or by using<br/>a Portable Scanner on the rack. Every component has<br/>a certain heat limit which if exceeded will void that<br/>component. Breaking or wrenching a rack while it is<br/>hot (>2000) will similarly void the components inside.<br/>The QC will explode if the heat exceeds 10,000 but<br/>no component has a heat limit greater than that, so<br/>don't worry too much about ruining your base.\n\n[note]Heat<br/>\u03b1 HeatConstant * overclock * overvolt^2[/note]\n\nThe<br/>power consumption of a rack is 1A ZPM regardless of<br/>the components inside.

If you would like to further<br/>increase the computation/s at the cost of power, adjust<br/>the overclock and overvolt values to 1.44 and 1.03,<br/>respectively. This will generate 2,526 computation/s<br/>at a cost of 583,217 EU/t (1.11A UV).\n\nIf the APUs<br/>are too bothersome to craft, try Crystalprocessor Mainframes<br/>instead but you will need different overclock and overvolt<br/>values to get the most out of them.
