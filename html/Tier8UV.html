The<br/>first and last slice are the only valid locations for hatches. The slices<br/>in between are primarily for computer racks. The Multiblock Structure Hologram<br/>Projector shows the minimum length QC, but holding multiple in a single<br/>stack will show/build longer versions up to the maximum length of 16. There<br/>is also a mandatory air block in front of the computer heat vents.\n\nOUTPUT.<br/>Computation is nothing more than an integer input for certain recipes--much<br/>like EU. There may exist a minimum throughput requirement, a threshold<br/>to reach, or both (NEI will tell you everything). Computation is generated<br/>every second by the QC, transmitted by an Optical Transmission Connector,<br/>received by an Optical Reception Connector, and \"consumed\" by the machine<br/>or process that needs it. There is no storing computation and there can<br/>only be ONE transmission or reception hatch connected to the same Optical<br/>Fiber Cables at a time. If absolutely necessary, the Network Switch with<br/>QOS can split/join connections but know that it takes both power and maintenance<br/>to run.\n\nAdditional QC can be chained together using another set of Optical<br/>Transmission and Optical Reception Connectors between machines, but they<br/>cannot wallshare the same Optical Transmission Connector.\n\nUNCERTAINTY.<br/>The QC has a unique maintenance requirement that can only be corrected<br/>by balancing the Schr\u00f6dinger Matrix inside an Uncertainty Resolver--an<br/>additional hatch that must go on either the first or last slice of the<br/>machine. Start with the basic Uncertainty Resolver, but know that there<br/>are two more tiers unlocked later on that lower the difficulty of the puzzle,<br/>or not?\n\nThe interface of the Uncertainty Resolver has the Schr\u00f6dinger<br/>Matrix in the middle and two sets of 8 buttons on the left and right. Clicking<br/>on one button and then another will switch the states of the two corresponding<br/>cells in the matrix. This means switching their blinking speed (in the<br/>basic Uncertainty Resolver) or their shade/color (in the Uncertainty Resolver<br/>X). The goal of the puzzle is to balance the states of the matrix around<br/>the glowing LED lights, turning all of them green.\n\nPARAMETERS. In the<br/>GUI of the controller, there are two configurable parameters, overclock<br/>and overvolt, that change how computation and heat are generated. Higher<br/>overclock values contribute the most to computation and higher overvolt<br/>values contribute the most to heat. Alone, this would encourage the player<br/>to make overclock as high as possible and overvolt as low as possible,<br/>but there is a penalty to computation for large differences between these<br/>two parameters. Furthermore, overvolt values <1 will cause the QC to randomly<br/>drop computation proportional to its distance from 1. It is highly encouraged<br/>to play around with these parameters, as all the best setups do.\n\nSee the<br/>adjacent quest for more information on computer racks and generating computation.<br/><br/>"

Every rack is also completely independent from every other rack<br/>which means it is not possible to have one rack with all circuits and another<br/>with all vents.\n\nThe computation of a rack is the sum of all the components'<br/>individual computation. For example, two APU (Tier 3) and two Cooling Cores<br/>have 240 + 240 + 0 + 0 = 480 base computation per second. However, computation<br/>changes significantly depending on the values for overclock and overvolt:\n\n[note]Computation<br/>= Base * (1+overclock^2) / (1+(overclock-overvolt)^2)[/note]\n\nThe heat<br/>of a rack is a value between 0 and 10,000 and is reported in the interface<br/>of the QC or by using a Portable Scanner on the rack. Every component has<br/>a certain heat limit which if exceeded will void that component. Breaking<br/>or wrenching a rack while it is hot (>2000) will similarly void the components<br/>inside. The QC will explode if the heat exceeds 10,000 but no component<br/>has a heat limit greater than that, so don't worry too much about ruining<br/>your base.\n\n[note]Heat \u03b1 HeatConstant * overclock * overvolt^2[/note]\n\nThe<br/>power consumption of a rack is 1A ZPM regardless of the components inside.<br/>This is in addition to the 1A ZPM of the QC itself. However, these EU/t<br/>values are directly proportional to overclock and overvolt which should<br/>increase as you unlock better circuits. Be sure to turn on the QC before<br/>the research station and only when you need it.\n\n[note]EU/t = 131,072 *<br/>overclock * overvolt * (racks + 1)[/note]\n\nTo get you started, craft 4x<br/>APU (Tier 3) and 4x Cooling Cores. Place two of each component in the two<br/>racks and the QC will safely produce 1,920 computation/s for just 393,215<br/>EU/t (0.75A UV) which is more than enough for researching the Wetware Mainframe.<br/>If you would like to further increase the computation/s at the cost of<br/>power, adjust the overclock and overvolt values to 1.44 and 1.03, respectively.<br/>This will generate 2,526 computation/s at a cost of 583,217 EU/t (1.11A<br/>UV).\n\nIf the APUs are too bothersome to craft, try Crystalprocessor Mainframes<br/>instead but you will need different overclock and overvolt values to get<br/>the most out of them.
