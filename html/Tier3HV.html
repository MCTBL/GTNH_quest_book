If using it as part of a Multifarm<br/>or Mob Farm, make sure to set the contents of the drawers,<br/>and lock them with a key so that it properly stores<br/>everything in an organized manner. If the drawers'<br/>contents aren't set, it will start filling starting<br/>from the ones closest. If you wish to have more than<br/>one drawer full of an item, put a void upgrade on the<br/>drawer further from the Controller, and it will fill<br/>the first one, then the second.\n\nIf you want to go<br/>around corners, use the Trim Drawers to extend the<br/>multiblock. If you want to have a second point to dump<br/>items into, use the Controller Slave (one per multiblock,<br/>automation only). Note that you can use a key on the<br/>Controller to affect all drawers at once.\n\nOnce you<br/>have an ME Network, place a storage bus on the Controller,<br/>and the entire inventory will be accessible from the<br/>network, with both storage and retrieval. Just remember<br/>to set the priority higher than your ME Drives. If<br/>you haven't locked them yet expect all your drawers<br/>to fill with random items from your ME Network.\n\n[warn]Using<br/>the drawer controller with large amounts of I/O will<br/>tank TPS! If you're on a server, do not use drawer<br/>cubes, or expect the possibility of it being deleted<br/>or you getting banned.\n\nAdditionally, expect all non-backpack<br/>interactions to be DISABLED on the official servers.<br/>Congratulations, Drawer Cubists, you ruined it for<br/>everyone.[/warn]<br/><br/>"
