UUMatter can be used for some very specific things, such as replicating<br/>some materials (check NEI, mostly/all periodic table), used with crops<br/>to create an ore, some specific high-level recipes need it, and...you can<br/>also sit in it to get regen.\n\nThe energy usage and overclocking of the<br/>Mass Fabricator is different than the usual GT way. To have fixed EU to<br/>UUM ratios for all tiers, the machine does perfect 2/2 overclocks. It also<br/>start with a very high amperage in LV. The following chart should make<br/>it more clear:\n\nTier  Amps       EU/t         Time\nLV     8A         256<br/>         160\nMV     4A         512           80\nHV     2A        1024 <br/>         40\nEV     1A        2048           20\nIV     0.5A      4096  <br/>        10\netc.\n\nPut in power (and hopefully UUA), and out comes UUM. You<br/>should also know that you can't use mass fabs or replicators with PAs.\n\nFor<br/>now, just stockpile the UU matter. You need data orbs to use the replicator,<br/>and that's explained next tier. \n\n[note]You only need to complete one of<br/>the tasks.[/note]"
