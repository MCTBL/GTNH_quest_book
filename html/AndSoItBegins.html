Your save<br/>file stores a version of the QB that can be different<br/>from the one in the file.\n\n/bq_admin edit\nToggles editing<br/>quests. Pressing RMB on the quest will open a context<br/>menu to share it or copy its ID.\n\n/bq_admin reset all<br/><Player>\nResets all quests. Use this if you want to<br/>start over, or are editing the QB. You should specify<br/>the player as well if it is a server, otherwise you<br/>can skip that part.\n\n/bq_admin reset <ID> <Player>\nResets<br/>a specific quest, defined by the quest ID. Sometimes<br/>it may be easier to go into Edit Mode > Designer Tool<br/>to specify what to reset.\n\n/bq_admin complete <number><br/><Player>\nCompletes a specific quest, similarly to the<br/>above. You can still claim the rewards. Use this command<br/>if a quest is broken, and then report it on GitHub,<br/>but please check if it's already reported.\n\n/bq_admin<br/>default save\nSaves changes to the QB after editing<br/>it.\n\n/bq_copyquests <PlayerWithQuestsCompleted> <NewPlayer>\nIf<br/>you want to sync the quests with someone in your party,<br/>then use this. They won't get any rewards for that<br/>though.\n\n/bq_admin hardcore\nEnables BQ3 Hardcore Mode.<br/>You only start with 3 lives, so best of luck. Additional<br/>life hearts are available in the Kill all the Things<br/>tab.\n\nAside from the consume-type quests, a quest counts<br/>for everyone in the party if one person finished it.<br/>However, if someone joined your party later, you need<br/>to get them up to speed first either through /bq_copyquests<br/>above, or manually. Otherwise, your quest completion<br/>won't count for them because the requirements for that<br/>quest are not fulfilled for them.\n\nIf your singleplayer<br/>world does not have cheats enabled, go to the ESC screen,<br/>open to LAN, then enable cheats. This makes pausing<br/>impossible until you reload afterwards. If you host<br/>a server, you can run the commands in the command line,<br/>without \"/\". You can also edit the level.dat file,<br/>and set 'allowCommands' to 1, but make sure to backup<br/>your world before doing that.\n\n[warn]For quests to<br/>save properly, you must be online and logged into your<br/>Mojang account when starting the game.

Maybe this seems<br/>impossible, but people have indeed reached UEV+ in<br/>Minecraft Hardcore. Better be prepared to restart a<br/>few times. This is obviously not for everybody.\n\n-<br/>Never make a rocket. The so called \u00a7ono-rocket run\u00a7r<br/>is somewhat supported by now, you will be able to do<br/>almost everything in the pack. Use bees, crops, and<br/>blood magic meteors as your main resource production.<br/>Be warned though that such a challenge is grindy and<br/>slow. For instance, you might need to collect large<br/>amounts of aluminium gravel to get your first titanium.<br/>Or have to start breeding bees early without much technology<br/>to help.\n\n- Skyblock. Yes, really. It is also known<br/>as Garden of Grind and it is absolutely brutal. There<br/>is no actually supported skyblock version of the pack<br/>but some players have figured out the minimal amount<br/>of changes needed to make it work. Ask around or search<br/>on the official discord channel for all the details.<br/>But don't expect any fun down this road.\n\n- Speedrunning.<br/>A few players have designed some basic rules and have<br/>started to record speedruns to early game goals like<br/>the Coke Oven. Ask around or search on the official<br/>discord channel for all the details. Maybe you just<br/>want to watch how they do it.<br/>"
