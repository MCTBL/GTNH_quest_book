You should specify<br/>the player as well if it is a server, otherwise you can skip that part.\n\n/bq_admin<br/>reset <ID> <Player>\nResets a specific quest, defined by the quest ID. Sometimes<br/>it may be easier to go into Edit Mode > Designer Tool to specify what to<br/>reset.\n\n/bq_admin complete <number> <Player>\nCompletes a specific quest,<br/>similarly to the above. You can still claim the rewards. Use this command<br/>if a quest is broken, and then report it on GitHub, but please check if<br/>it's already reported.\n\n/bq_admin default save\nSaves changes to the QB<br/>after editing it.\n\n/bq_copyquests <PlayerWithQuestsCompleted> <NewPlayer>\nIf<br/>you want to sync the quests with someone in your party, then use this.<br/>They won't get any rewards for that though.\n\n/bq_admin hardcore\nEnables<br/>BQ3 Hardcore Mode. You only start with 3 lives, so best of luck. Additional<br/>life hearts are available in the Kill all the Things tab.\n\nAside from the<br/>consume-type quests, a quest counts for everyone in the party if one person<br/>finished it. However, if someone joined your party later, you need to get<br/>them up to speed first either through /bq_copyquests above, or manually.<br/>Otherwise, your quest completion won't count for them because the requirements<br/>for that quest are not fulfilled for them.\n\nIf your singleplayer world<br/>does not have cheats enabled, go to the ESC screen, open to LAN, then enable<br/>cheats. This makes pausing impossible until you reload afterwards. If you<br/>host a server, you can run the commands in the command line, without \"/\".<br/>You can also edit the level.dat file, and set 'allowCommands' to 1, but<br/>make sure to backup your world before doing that.\n\n[warn]For quests to<br/>save properly, you must be online and logged into your Mojang account when<br/>starting the game.

With default<br/>settings, you will not be able to chunkload. Feel free to change that in<br/>the config if you are in singleplayer (SP) or running your own server.\n\n2)<br/>Use four types of Anchors from Railcraft, although they are not craftable<br/>until the Low Voltage (LV) tier. In SP, or a server you run, cheat in Admin<br/>Anchors to chunkload forever, for free. They're limited on servers to prevent<br/>TPS dropping from people chunkloading a base forever when they aren't even<br/>there. On the officials, you need to use Ender Fragments, Ender Pearls,<br/>or Coins to fuel them. Look at the tooltip on each for how long it will<br/>work, and in what chunkloader.\n\n3) Use one of the blocks that chunkloads<br/>itself. If you do this on a server, expect the admins to possibly get very<br/>mad at you if it's not something you're allowed to do. Same for vanilla<br/>methods.\n\nDon't use chicken chunks to get anchor-like blocks. It's buggy."

It doesn't play well with all the custom versions of mods<br/>that this pack has. So if you have any problems, first switch to another<br/>launcher like MultiMC, Prism, or Technic.
