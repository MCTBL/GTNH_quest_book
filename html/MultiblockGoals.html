It's not the name of the game... but it could be!\n\nIf you've<br/>ever wanted to generate many chemicals from a single source, you've probably<br/>looked at Oil or Benzene. However there's also the Algae Farm. It's just<br/>a pond of sorts, so it doesn't need power to run. Since it also doesn't<br/>really follow normal recipes, you won't find any NEI recipe page for the<br/>Algae. The multi just produces them on a regular schedule.\n\nThe tier of<br/>the multi is given by the casings on the bottom layer of the multi, which<br/>all have to match to decide the tier. Each tier from ULV (starting at 50s<br/>per batch) till IV (which is 25s per batch) reduces the time it takes to<br/>produce Algae by about 5 seconds, and then beyond that each tier will cut<br/>the speed in half. The cases will currently work up to UHV cases, and casings<br/>beyond that will not work with this machine. Randomly the production speed<br/>can either double or triple the time it takes as well, but this happens<br/>relatively rarely.\n\nEach tier increase also adds to the amount of Algae<br/>you get in a single cycle, as well as the type of Algae produced. Each<br/>cycle gives out an exact amount as well as a bonus amount 10% of the time.<br/>The Algae Farm also accepts Compost, that you can make from the algae itself,<br/>to boost the multi's tier by one. This might be expensive at the start,<br/>but it's heavily recommended in most cases. You can get regular Algae and<br/>Green Algae starting at ULV, Brown Algae starts appearing at HV, Golden-Brown<br/>Algae at EV, and Red Algae at IV, though most of the cases where they start<br/>appearing they start doing so in very small quantities.\n\nTo find out more<br/>about the exact output quantities and timings, please see the wiki: [url]https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Algae_Farm[/url]\n\nThe<br/>Algae can be used for various chemicals like Methane, Ammonia, Sulfuric<br/>Acid, Sodium Carbonate, Ethylene, Lithium Chloride, and even some power-generating<br/>fluids. You typically need a Chemical Plant for that. In IV tier you can<br/>also combine Green Algae with Glowstone to get Glowing Coral and make Sunnarium<br/>from that. If you're curious about all the processing chains, look them<br/>up on NEI: quests to cover them are coming up, possibly with more recipes<br/>that don't need the chemplant.<br/><br/>"

However,<br/>like the plants that have Awakened Draconium coils or higher, it does not<br/>consume the catalyst\u2019s durability on recipe finish, behaving more like<br/>a real-life catalyst that is regenerated after being used. This makes the<br/>catalysts used here more expensive to craft, as was the case with the Infinite<br/>Mutation Catalyst for Mutated Living Solder, which is meant to be used<br/>only with those coils that make it last forever.\n\nGiven that there is no<br/>durability loss, it would seem only one catalyst needs to be crafted. However,<br/>there are two reasons for this to not be true: firstly, each QFT recipe<br/>uses a different catalyst; secondly, the QFT checks for parallels by counting<br/>the amount of catalysts it has in its input buses for the recipe in question<br/>(with a maximum of 64 parallels, for a stack of the correct catalyst).<br/>This system makes it so that crafting 1 of the correct type of catalyst<br/>is required to unlock a recipe, but making more is completely optional<br/>and only changes the speed at which the multi crafts, provided it gets<br/>enough EU input.\n\nEvery catalyst needs some of the materials that it unlocks<br/>in the QFT, which is to say, the original processing line will have to<br/>be used to craft the catalyst that allows the player to skip it in the<br/>QFT. This applies to every recipe, and in turn every line that can be skipped.\n\nTo<br/>improve the general speed of processing, your one options is to get more<br/>parallels with catalysts. The other, more complicated way is to boost the<br/>chances of a successful output by adding more energy to the system, but<br/>in a special way: instead of using direct EU, using it to create a powerful<br/>plasma works to improve the QFT processing.\n\nIf the correct plasmas are<br/>added, the boosting will work, but it is also possible to upgrade the structure<br/>itself to perform chemistry skips that are not possible with the base QFT.<br/>These upgrades rely on more advanced and powerful materials, mainly in<br/>the material progression of DTPF recipes. However, those existing materials<br/>are not enough, because the quantum stabilization can\u2019t be maintained with<br/>those \u201cforeign\u201d substances. Luckily, the QFT itself can produce the items<br/>needed to build the upgraded casings, and these items are outputs of some<br/>of the skips performed in the multi. It begins by allowing the much simpler<br/>production of already-owned materials but, in this process, it unlocks<br/>entirely new materials that are useful to improve the structure itself.\n\nThere<br/>are three new items and four tiers in the structure. The first tier can<br/>be built without them, but every new tier needs a new item crafted in the<br/>tier before. These outputs are related to the recipe where they can be<br/>obtained, and they possess unique characteristics that, in real life, are<br/>only theoretical.\n\nThe first item you will need to craft is the Hyper-Stable<br/>Self-Healing Adhesive. To craft this material, proceed with the Glue/Solder<br/>recipe by using the Adhesion Promoter Catalyst. Additionally, make these<br/>other catalysts to prove you're well set in your QFT journey.\n<br/><br/>"

However,<br/>the truly wise are the ones who know what is unimportant and can be skipped.<br/>For a true breacher of technology, the constraints of physics and chemistry<br/>are not essential. To skip past their technicalities, the Quantum Force<br/>Transformer comes into play.\n\nThis multi is meant to replicate the most<br/>popular and important processing lines in the pack\u2019s progression, mostly<br/>those related to chemistry. Because of recursion in recipes, where earlier<br/>tier materials are required to craft higher tier equivalents, there are<br/>a lot of early processing lines that stay up through progression. Even<br/>worse, they often need more and more machines to keep up with increasing<br/>speed demands. To save on lag, this multi will do those processing lines<br/>in one step and without most of the extra chemicals that are added to purify<br/>the inputs into the outputs.\n\nThe Quantum Force Transformer (QFT) is unlocked<br/>in UEV, after Optical Mainframes have been crafted, and with the addition<br/>of a single Eternal Singularity and other materials. It\u2019s a tall, 15x15<br/>multiblock with many different casings, including two that are upgradable<br/>and decide the two tiers of the multi. Although it\u2019s available in UEV,<br/>the upgraded casings require more and more expensive materials, while also<br/>unlocking skips for more advanced processing lines. For example, a platline<br/>skip can be done in the earlier QFT tier, whereas a Kevlar skip can only<br/>be done in the last tier.\n\nEach recipe that the QFT has represents a single<br/>processing line or a big part of a line. The inputs for the early plastic<br/>skip, for example, are the basic components of the plastics on a molecular<br/>level (Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc.), and not the multi-step chemicals<br/>that were used half a dozen tiers earlier. All recipes have 3 or more outputs,<br/>and every output has a chance to appear: the chance for each is 100% divided<br/>by the number of outputs. To increase it, there are additional mechanics<br/>that can be used.\n\nSimply put, the QFT uses huge amounts of energy and<br/>quantum field stabilization to disassemble simple molecules and assemble<br/>them into more complex ones, without needing additives or constrained processes.<br/>The only addition to the base inputs that the multi requires is a specific<br/>catalyst, which the smart circuits use to guide the materials into what<br/>they ultimately transform into, but they are never consumed or lost in<br/>any way. \n\nThis direct process simplifies long processing chains to one<br/>step, but it has two consequences: it makes the process expensive, given<br/>the extreme conditions needed to undergo the transformation (in a similar<br/>way to fusion), but it also generates many different outputs at once, none<br/>of which are guaranteed, and it\u2019s impossible to choose between them without<br/>adding something else into the setup to alter the conditions inside the<br/>QFT in some way. Throwing more energy into the multi won\u2019t do anything,<br/>and better materials don\u2019t seem to work, so what is the next step? That<br/>is what the next two quests will answer.\n<br/>"

The rest of the structure is built out of Plascrete<br/>Blocks.\n\nUp to 30% of those Plascrete Blocks can be replaced by other valid<br/>blocks or materials:\n\nA Reinforced Door lets you get in and out of the<br/>cleanroom. Make sure to keep the doors closed, or the cleanroom will rapidly<br/>lose efficiency. Travel Anchors and Elevators also work, you can even embed<br/>them in the floor if you want to.\n\nIn order to automate power and item<br/>transport through the walls, you can use Cable Diodes or Machine Hulls.<br/>Just be really careful when upgrading your machines to a higher voltage.<br/>Be sure to remove the machine hulls and diodes and replace them with the<br/>new power tier, or else you will be very sad.

It starts out at 40 EU/t and then gradually goes down.<br/>But even when it uses 40 EU/t - which is usually MV - a single LV energy<br/>hatch suffices, as long as you give it enough power. Just keep in mind<br/>that this makes the Cleanroom an exception, not the rule.\n\nLet's build<br/>a 5x5x5 room for now. You can expand it later as needed. Give it power<br/>and let it run until it reaches 100% efficiency. Below 100% efficiency,<br/>machines inside the cleanroom have a chance to void outputs, so you want<br/>to keep the cleanroom running at all times!\n\nAny maintenance issue reduces<br/>the maximum efficiency by 10%. Monitor your cleanroom with a Hand Scanner,<br/>Industrial Information Panel, or using a Needs Maintenance Cover and a<br/>Redstone Powered Light or Howler Alarm.\n\n\n[note]Multiblocks such as the<br/>Large Chemical Reactor or Hyper-Intensity Laser Engraver don't need to<br/>be in a cleanroom. However, you will still need the cleanroom later on<br/>for other machines, like Bio Labs.[/note]\n\n[note]Other helpful hints: you<br/>can use an AE Wireless Connector or a Transvector Interface for item transport<br/>to avoid machine hulls, and use a higher tier energy hatch to reach 100%<br/>efficiency faster.[/note]\n\n[warn]Keep in mind that you can not use anything<br/>in the cleanroom that causes pollution, or the cleanroom will stop working.[/warn]<br/><br/>"

With [note]UV[/note] glass you can<br/>have an energy tier as high as you want.\nShift click with screwdriver to<br/>change crop type (IC2/normal), sadly you can't farm both in one machine.\nThere<br/>are 3 modes to manage your crops (change with screwdriver):\n\nSetup mode<br/>(input):\nIn this mode you can plant your crops in the machine.\nJust put<br/>them in the input bus and enable the machine with a soft mallet.\nAdditionally,<br/>you need to insert block that is required for IC2 crop to grow (if any)\nWhen<br/>the bus is empty, just disable it and change the mode.\nKeep in mind that<br/>there is limited space of slots for your crops depending on the voltage.\nWith<br/>normal crops you start with 1 slot and that multiplies by 2 every tier<br/>past EV, every slot can take 64 crops of the same type.\nWith IC2 crops<br/>you start with 4 slots and that multiplies by 4 every tier past LuV, every<br/>slot can take only 1 crop.\n\nSetup mode (output):\nThis mode allows you to<br/>move your Greenhouse or upgrade your crops.\nWhen the machine is running<br/>in this mode it will output all planted crops in the output bus.\n\nNormal<br/>operation:\nWith normal crops it is a straightforward process. Base processing<br/>time is 5 seconds, at the end of operation all crops are grown and the<br/>outputs are added to the output bus. Additionally the time is lower every<br/>tier past EV (The time is divided by the number of tiers past HV, minimum<br/>1 second. WOW)\n\nIC2 crops on the other hand, are not that easy. They are<br/>normally simulated, but accelerated 32 times. Process time is 5 seconds.<br/>You can check the progress of the growing process with a tricorder.\n\nIf<br/>you want to grow your crops even faster, then you can use a fertilizer<br/>(up to 400% more drops !). Machine will take fertilizer from the input<br/>busses on start of the operation and will be applied to that operation<br/>only. Each fertilizer gives +200% per crop in normal mode or +10% in IC2<br/>mode. The bonus is applied evenly on crops. Examples:\nNormal mode, 3 wheat<br/>seeds, 1 tea seeds, you insert 1 fertilizer, you will get +150% wheat drops<br/>and +50% tea drops.\nIC2 mode, 16 melon seed bags, you insert 64 fertilizer,<br/>you will get +40% drops.\n\nAdditionally, all your crops need water to grow.<br/>Every single crop drinks 1000L per operation. So for example if you have<br/>planted 576 tea seeds at [note]UV[/note] voltage you will need 576000 L<br/>per second.\n\nLast notes:\nThe animation can\u2019t be disabled.\nThe lamps can<br/>be inverted.\nThe dirt must be tilled.\nIf you encounter any issue or have<br/>any suggestion please open an issue on github and ping @kuba6000.\nThis<br/>MB was created to farm tea because I wanted to.\n<br/>"

Each method<br/>uses a new plasma, both of which are crafted in a T4 Fusion Reactor by<br/>using other plasmas as the inputs, including one T3 plasma for each. These<br/>plasmas are Neptunium and Fermium and they can be used together, or individually.\n\nWhen<br/>Neptunium Plasma is present, the current recipe can have one of the outputs<br/>focused. The specific output is chosen with a circuit in the input bus<br/>(this is the only thing circuits do for this multi), where circuit 1 is<br/>for the 1st output visible in NEI, circuit 2 is for the 2nd output, and<br/>so on. It is up to the player to choose which output they want the most<br/>out of all the existing ones, and the fact that every recipe has multiple<br/>outputs is because of this mechanic.\n\nWhen an output is successfully focused<br/>with Neptunium, its chance increases by reducing the chance of all the<br/>other outputs. The logic for this change is as follows:\n\n-> Without focusing,<br/>the chance of each output is 100 / number of outputs;\n-> If the casing<br/>tier matches the recipe tier, the chance of all other outputs is halved<br/>and the sum of those halves is added to the focused output (for example,<br/>20/20/20/20/20 becomes 60/10/10/10/10);\n-> If the casing tier is +1 over<br/>the recipe tier, halve the other outputs' chance again (for example, 60/10/10/10/10<br/>becomes 80/5/5/5/5);\n-> If the casing tier is +2 or +3 over the recipe<br/>tier, set the focused output to 100% and the rest to 0%.\n\nIn general, this<br/>type of focusing doesn\u2019t increase the total amount of outputs, save for<br/>the new items added with this multi that will come out in smaller quantities.<br/>Instead, it allows the player to replace less useful outputs with the more<br/>useful ones, and this choice is completely up to them, as is the choice<br/>of focusing at all.\n\nWhen Fermium Plasma is present, the current recipe<br/>will have all of its output chances boosted, unless the chance for one<br/>of them is 100%, in which case that chance is unchanged. This happens because<br/>the boost increases if the output chance before ferm focusing is smaller,<br/>and the maximum boost is achieved when the chance is 0%, which happens<br/>with high-tier nep focusing.\n\nWhen an output is successfully focused with<br/>Fermium, its chance increases based on how far it is from 100% chance.<br/>This applies to all the outputs at once, and the logic for this change<br/>is as follows:\n\n-> If the casing tier matches the recipe tier, each output<br/>gets increased by 1/4 of the \"failure\" chance (for example, a 50% chance<br/>output has a 50% chance of failure, so it gets boosted by 12.5%, becoming<br/>62.5%)\n-> If the casing tier is +1 over the recipe tier, each output gets<br/>increased by 1/3 of the \"failure\" chance\n-> If the casing tier is +2 or<br/>+3 over the recipe tier, each output gets increased by 1/2 of the \"failure\"<br/>chance\n\nWith the two plasmas combined and a +2 or +3 over recipe tier,<br/>a 5-output recipe would normally have 20/20/20/20/20 chances, but it becomes<br/>100/50/50/50/50.\n\nMany lategame multis have parallels, which means they<br/>complete the recipe several times at once every time the recipe time is<br/>completed, instead of only one, but they require extra EU to achieve this.<br/>This makes power the biggest constraint for those multiblocks, and the<br/>same happens with the QFT, given that recipe inputs are generally very<br/>cheap and simple. Throwing more power at the machine means more outputs,<br/>in general.\n\nGiven that, a player that wants a faster QFT will make more<br/>catalysts to unlock more parallels, but each added parallels adds to the<br/>other ones, to a cap of 64. Focusing, instead, changes output odds, which<br/>effectively multiplies the number of outputs per cycle. In terms of speed,<br/>a recipe with 4 outputs and 64 parallels runs at the speed of 256 parallels<br/>for the focused output if it\u2019s nep focused to the maximum of 100%, since<br/>it was 25% originally. \n\nThis is a lot of saved EU for high-tier, high-parallel<br/>QFTs, so it is the main reason for focusing, and both plasmas are useful<br/>here. However, plasma consumption is not the same regardless of parallels,<br/>it instead scales with the square root of the number of correct catalysts<br/>for the recipe, which is to say, the number of parallels.\n\nThis further<br/>applies to the 3 new items that are needed to upgrade the casing tiers.<br/>Since their output amount is much smaller than usual, they could get a<br/>further boost if focusing is being used, to incentivize the plasma mechanic<br/>when upgrading the multi.<br/><br/>"

What it doesn't make in power, it compensates in breeding,<br/>however.\n\nFor the unaware, this is expensive. Pebble reactors work by stuffing<br/>the reactor absolutely full of pebbles, and then the reaction will keep<br/>going for, essentially, forever. In this case, you will have a fully automated<br/>source of almost endless Lutetium, Plutonium and other things that will<br/>be explained in the following quests, alongside the production of fuel<br/>and the processing of outputs.

Pollution is nobody's<br/>friend!\n\nDuring setup, make sure the center of the EBF is hollow. Sometimes<br/>things can sneak in there without you noticing, like a Thaumcraft light<br/>orb!\n\nMake sure your muffler faces out, not in. The EBF can't work if it<br/>is not spreading those delightful odors!\n\nWhen placing your power hatches,<br/>make sure to minimize the distance between any generators and the EBF.<br/>Especially at LV, those few blocks make a big difference! Every amp of<br/>energy traveling over a cable loses a little bit - and you'll need as much<br/>as you can get! Your best setup is to put two generators right next to<br/>each hatch, with a 2A cable. If you're poor, you could use 2 battery buffers<br/>with 2 batteries each directly attached to each hatch. Make sure to top<br/>off the buffers' generators.
