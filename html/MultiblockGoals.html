It's not the name of the game... but<br/>it could be!\n\nIf you've ever wanted to generate many<br/>chemicals from a single source, you've probably looked<br/>at Oil or Benzene. However there's also the Algae Farm.<br/>It's just a pond of sorts, so it doesn't need power<br/>to run. Since it also doesn't really follow normal<br/>recipes, you won't find any NEI recipe page for the<br/>Algae. The multi just produces them on a regular schedule.\n\nThe<br/>tier of the multi is given by the casings on the bottom<br/>layer of the multi, which all have to match to decide<br/>the tier. Each tier from ULV (starting at 50s per batch)<br/>till IV (which is 25s per batch) reduces the time it<br/>takes to produce Algae by about 5 seconds, and then<br/>beyond that each tier will cut the speed in half. The<br/>cases will currently work up to UHV cases, and casings<br/>beyond that will not work with this machine. Randomly<br/>the production speed can either double or triple the<br/>time it takes as well, but this happens relatively<br/>rarely.\n\nEach tier increase also adds to the amount<br/>of Algae you get in a single cycle, as well as the<br/>type of Algae produced. Each cycle gives out an exact<br/>amount as well as a bonus amount 10% of the time. The<br/>Algae Farm also accepts Compost, that you can make<br/>from the algae itself, to boost the multi's tier by<br/>one. This might be expensive at the start, but it's<br/>heavily recommended in most cases. You can get regular<br/>Algae and Green Algae starting at ULV, Brown Algae<br/>starts appearing at HV, Golden-Brown Algae at EV, and<br/>Red Algae at IV, though most of the cases where they<br/>start appearing they start doing so in very small quantities.\n\nTo<br/>find out more about the exact output quantities and<br/>timings, please see the wiki: [url]https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Algae_Farm[/url]\n\nThe<br/>Algae can be used for various chemicals like Methane,<br/>Ammonia, Sulfuric Acid, Sodium Carbonate, Ethylene,<br/>Lithium Chloride, and even some power-generating fluids.<br/>You typically need a Chemical Plant for that. In IV<br/>tier you can also combine Green Algae with Glowstone<br/>to get Glowing Coral and make Sunnarium from that.<br/>If you're curious about all the processing chains,<br/>look them up on NEI: quests to cover them are coming<br/>up, possibly with more recipes that don't need the<br/>chemplant.<br/><br/>"

This makes the catalysts used here<br/>more expensive to craft, as was the case with the Infinite<br/>Mutation Catalyst for Mutated Living Solder, which<br/>is meant to be used only with those coils that make<br/>it last forever.\n\nGiven that there is no durability<br/>loss, it would seem only one catalyst needs to be crafted.<br/>However, there are two reasons for this to not be true:<br/>firstly, each QFT recipe uses a different catalyst;<br/>secondly, the QFT checks for parallels by counting<br/>the amount of catalysts it has in its input buses for<br/>the recipe in question (with a maximum of 64 parallels,<br/>for a stack of the correct catalyst). This system makes<br/>it so that crafting 1 of the correct type of catalyst<br/>is required to unlock a recipe, but making more is<br/>completely optional and only changes the speed at which<br/>the multi crafts, provided it gets enough EU input.\n\nEvery<br/>catalyst needs some of the materials that it unlocks<br/>in the QFT, which is to say, the original processing<br/>line will have to be used to craft the catalyst that<br/>allows the player to skip it in the QFT. This applies<br/>to every recipe, and in turn every line that can be<br/>skipped.\n\nTo improve the general speed of processing,<br/>your one options is to get more parallels with catalysts.<br/>The other, more complicated way is to boost the chances<br/>of a successful output by adding more energy to the<br/>system, but in a special way: instead of using direct<br/>EU, using it to create a powerful plasma works to improve<br/>the QFT processing.\n\nIf the correct plasmas are added,<br/>the boosting will work, but it is also possible to<br/>upgrade the structure itself to perform chemistry skips<br/>that are not possible with the base QFT. These upgrades<br/>rely on more advanced and powerful materials, mainly<br/>in the material progression of DTPF recipes. However,<br/>those existing materials are not enough, because the<br/>quantum stabilization can\u2019t be maintained with those<br/>\u201cforeign\u201d substances. Luckily, the QFT itself can produce<br/>the items needed to build the upgraded casings, and<br/>these items are outputs of some of the skips performed<br/>in the multi. It begins by allowing the much simpler<br/>production of already-owned materials but, in this<br/>process, it unlocks entirely new materials that are<br/>useful to improve the structure itself.\n\nThere are<br/>three new items and four tiers in the structure. The<br/>first tier can be built without them, but every new<br/>tier needs a new item crafted in the tier before. These<br/>outputs are related to the recipe where they can be<br/>obtained, and they possess unique characteristics that,<br/>in real life, are only theoretical.\n\nThe first item<br/>you will need to craft is the Hyper-Stable Self-Healing<br/>Adhesive. To craft this material, proceed with the<br/>Glue/Solder recipe by using the Adhesion Promoter Catalyst.<br/>Additionally, make these other catalysts to prove you're<br/>well set in your QFT journey.\n<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

For a<br/>true breacher of technology, the constraints of physics<br/>and chemistry are not essential. To skip past their<br/>technicalities, the Quantum Force Transformer comes<br/>into play.\n\nThis multi is meant to replicate the most<br/>popular and important processing lines in the pack\u2019s<br/>progression, mostly those related to chemistry. Because<br/>of recursion in recipes, where earlier tier materials<br/>are required to craft higher tier equivalents, there<br/>are a lot of early processing lines that stay up through<br/>progression. Even worse, they often need more and more<br/>machines to keep up with increasing speed demands.<br/>To save on lag, this multi will do those processing<br/>lines in one step and without most of the extra chemicals<br/>that are added to purify the inputs into the outputs.\n\nThe<br/>Quantum Force Transformer (QFT) is unlocked in UEV,<br/>after Optical Mainframes have been crafted, and with<br/>the addition of a single Eternal Singularity and other<br/>materials. It\u2019s a tall, 15x15 multiblock with many<br/>different casings, including two that are upgradable<br/>and decide the two tiers of the multi. Although it\u2019s<br/>available in UEV, the upgraded casings require more<br/>and more expensive materials, while also unlocking<br/>skips for more advanced processing lines. For example,<br/>a platline skip can be done in the earlier QFT tier,<br/>whereas a Kevlar skip can only be done in the last<br/>tier.\n\nEach recipe that the QFT has represents a single<br/>processing line or a big part of a line. The inputs<br/>for the early plastic skip, for example, are the basic<br/>components of the plastics on a molecular level (Carbon,<br/>Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc.), and not the multi-step chemicals<br/>that were used half a dozen tiers earlier. All recipes<br/>have 3 or more outputs, and every output has a chance<br/>to appear: the chance for each is 100% divided by the<br/>number of outputs. To increase it, there are additional<br/>mechanics that can be used.\n\nSimply put, the QFT uses<br/>huge amounts of energy and quantum field stabilization<br/>to disassemble simple molecules and assemble them into<br/>more complex ones, without needing additives or constrained<br/>processes. The only addition to the base inputs that<br/>the multi requires is a specific catalyst, which the<br/>smart circuits use to guide the materials into what<br/>they ultimately transform into, but they are never<br/>consumed or lost in any way. \n\nThis direct process<br/>simplifies long processing chains to one step, but<br/>it has two consequences: it makes the process expensive,<br/>given the extreme conditions needed to undergo the<br/>transformation (in a similar way to fusion), but it<br/>also generates many different outputs at once, none<br/>of which are guaranteed, and it\u2019s impossible to choose<br/>between them without adding something else into the<br/>setup to alter the conditions inside the QFT in some<br/>way. Throwing more energy into the multi won\u2019t do anything,<br/>and better materials don\u2019t seem to work, so what is<br/>the next step? That is what the next two quests will<br/>answer.\n<br/><br/><br/>"

Travel Anchors and Elevators<br/>also work, you can even embed them in the floor if<br/>you want to.\n\nIn order to automate power and item transport<br/>through the walls, you can use Cable Diodes or Machine<br/>Hulls. Just be really careful when upgrading your machines<br/>to a higher voltage. Be sure to remove the machine<br/>hulls and diodes and replace them with the new power<br/>tier, or else you will be very sad. You don't need<br/>to do this for ones you only use to pass items through.\n\nIf<br/>you want to see inside, you can use any EV+ tier glass<br/>(for example, Reinforced Glass or Managlass). If the<br/>Cleanroom does not form, mind the 30% limit: often<br/>the problem is that you added too much glass.\n\nFinally,<br/>the Cleanroom itself will need a Maintenance and Energy<br/>Hatch to run. The power usage of this multiblock is<br/>a bit unusual. It starts out at 40 EU/t and then gradually<br/>goes down. But even when it uses 40 EU/t - which is<br/>usually MV - a single LV energy hatch suffices, as<br/>long as you give it enough power. Just keep in mind<br/>that this makes the Cleanroom an exception, not the<br/>rule.\n\nLet's build a 5x5x5 room for now. You can expand<br/>it later as needed. Give it power and let it run until<br/>it reaches 100% efficiency. Below 100% efficiency,<br/>machines inside the cleanroom have a chance to void<br/>outputs, so you want to keep the cleanroom running<br/>at all times!\n\nAny maintenance issue reduces the maximum<br/>efficiency by 10%. Monitor your cleanroom with a Hand<br/>Scanner, Industrial Information Panel, or using a Needs<br/>Maintenance Cover and a Redstone Powered Light or Howler<br/>Alarm.\n\n\n[note]Multiblocks such as the Large Chemical<br/>Reactor or Hyper-Intensity Laser Engraver don't need<br/>to be in a cleanroom. However, you will still need<br/>the cleanroom later on for other machines, like Bio<br/>Labs.[/note]\n\n[note]Other helpful hints: you can use<br/>an AE Wireless Connector or a Transvector Interface<br/>for item transport to avoid machine hulls, and use<br/>a higher tier energy hatch to reach 100% efficiency<br/>faster.[/note]\n\n[warn]Keep in mind that you can not<br/>use anything in the cleanroom that causes pollution,<br/>or the cleanroom will stop working.[/warn]<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Machine will<br/>take fertilizer from the input busses on start of the<br/>operation and will be applied to that operation only.<br/>Each fertilizer gives +200% per crop in normal mode<br/>or +10% in IC2 mode. The bonus is applied evenly on<br/>crops. Examples:\nNormal mode, 3 wheat seeds, 1 tea<br/>seeds, you insert 1 fertilizer, you will get +150%<br/>wheat drops and +50% tea drops.\nIC2 mode, 16 melon<br/>seed bags, you insert 64 fertilizer, you will get +40%<br/>drops.\n\nAdditionally, all your crops need water to<br/>grow.

However, it\u2019s greatly incentivized when<br/>the number of parallels is high and when crafting the<br/>unique items that unlock higher tiers. \u201cFocusing\u201d,<br/>in general, means to increase the chances of the outputs<br/>in a QFT recipe, and it can be done in two ways, possibly<br/>both at the same time. Each method uses a new plasma,<br/>both of which are crafted in a T4 Fusion Reactor by<br/>using other plasmas as the inputs, including one T3<br/>plasma for each. These plasmas are Neptunium and Fermium<br/>and they can be used together, or individually.\n\nWhen<br/>Neptunium Plasma is present, the current recipe can<br/>have one of the outputs focused. The specific output<br/>is chosen with a circuit in the input bus (this is<br/>the only thing circuits do for this multi), where circuit<br/>1 is for the 1st output visible in NEI, circuit 2 is<br/>for the 2nd output, and so on. It is up to the player<br/>to choose which output they want the most out of all<br/>the existing ones, and the fact that every recipe has<br/>multiple outputs is because of this mechanic.\n\nWhen<br/>an output is successfully focused with Neptunium, its<br/>chance increases by reducing the chance of all the<br/>other outputs. The logic for this change is as follows:\n\n-><br/>Without focusing, the chance of each output is 100<br/>/ number of outputs;\n-> If the casing tier matches<br/>the recipe tier, the chance of all other outputs is<br/>halved and the sum of those halves is added to the<br/>focused output (for example, 20/20/20/20/20 becomes<br/>60/10/10/10/10);\n-> If the casing tier is +1 over the<br/>recipe tier, halve the other outputs' chance again<br/>(for example, 60/10/10/10/10 becomes 80/5/5/5/5);\n-><br/>If the casing tier is +2 or +3 over the recipe tier,<br/>set the focused output to 100% and the rest to 0%.\n\nIn<br/>general, this type of focusing doesn\u2019t increase the<br/>total amount of outputs, save for the new items added<br/>with this multi that will come out in smaller quantities.<br/>Instead, it allows the player to replace less useful<br/>outputs with the more useful ones, and this choice<br/>is completely up to them, as is the choice of focusing<br/>at all.\n\nWhen Fermium Plasma is present, the current<br/>recipe will have all of its output chances boosted,<br/>unless the chance for one of them is 100%, in which<br/>case that chance is unchanged. This happens because<br/>the boost increases if the output chance before ferm<br/>focusing is smaller, and the maximum boost is achieved<br/>when the chance is 0%, which happens with high-tier<br/>nep focusing.\n\nWhen an output is successfully focused<br/>with Fermium, its chance increases based on how far<br/>it is from 100% chance. This applies to all the outputs<br/>at once, and the logic for this change is as follows:\n\n-><br/>If the casing tier matches the recipe tier, each output<br/>gets increased by 1/4 of the \"failure\" chance (for<br/>example, a 50% chance output has a 50% chance of failure,<br/>so it gets boosted by 12.5%, becoming 62.5%)\n-> If<br/>the casing tier is +1 over the recipe tier, each output<br/>gets increased by 1/3 of the \"failure\" chance\n-> If<br/>the casing tier is +2 or +3 over the recipe tier, each<br/>output gets increased by 1/2 of the \"failure\" chance\n\nWith<br/>the two plasmas combined and a +2 or +3 over recipe<br/>tier, a 5-output recipe would normally have 20/20/20/20/20<br/>chances, but it becomes 100/50/50/50/50.\n\nMany lategame<br/>multis have parallels, which means they complete the<br/>recipe several times at once every time the recipe<br/>time is completed, instead of only one, but they require<br/>extra EU to achieve this. This makes power the biggest<br/>constraint for those multiblocks, and the same happens<br/>with the QFT, given that recipe inputs are generally<br/>very cheap and simple. Throwing more power at the machine<br/>means more outputs, in general.\n\nGiven that, a player<br/>that wants a faster QFT will make more catalysts to<br/>unlock more parallels, but each added parallels adds<br/>to the other ones, to a cap of 64. Focusing, instead,<br/>changes output odds, which effectively multiplies the<br/>number of outputs per cycle. In terms of speed, a recipe<br/>with 4 outputs and 64 parallels runs at the speed of<br/>256 parallels for the focused output if it\u2019s nep focused<br/>to the maximum of 100%, since it was 25% originally.<br/>\n\nThis is a lot of saved EU for high-tier, high-parallel<br/>QFTs, so it is the main reason for focusing, and both<br/>plasmas are useful here. However, plasma consumption<br/>is not the same regardless of parallels, it instead<br/>scales with the square root of the number of correct<br/>catalysts for the recipe, which is to say, the number<br/>of parallels.\n\nThis further applies to the 3 new items<br/>that are needed to upgrade the casing tiers. Since<br/>their output amount is much smaller than usual, they<br/>could get a further boost if focusing is being used,<br/>to incentivize the plasma mechanic when upgrading the<br/>multi.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

However, it doesn't<br/>really make a lot of power, and doesn't even match<br/>the EU/t of THTR, despite being much more expensive.<br/>The multiblock structure is basically the same, a huge<br/>reactor around 12x12x12 blocks in size, with 500+ casings<br/>made with Europium. What it doesn't make in power,<br/>it compensates in breeding, however.\n\nFor the unaware,<br/>this is expensive. Pebble reactors work by stuffing<br/>the reactor absolutely full of pebbles, and then the<br/>reaction will keep going for, essentially, forever.<br/>In this case, you will have a fully automated source<br/>of almost endless Lutetium, Plutonium and other things<br/>that will be explained in the following quests, alongside<br/>the production of fuel and the processing of outputs.<br/>What this means is that this is an expensive multiblock,<br/>but it's placed a tier in which this expense is actually<br/>reasonable, if there is a need for immense, endless<br/>breeding of many outputs.\n\nIf you're on the fence about<br/>building this, check the next quests to learn more<br/>about the fuel and outputs.\n\nNotes:\n\nHTGR has an internal<br/>buffer for fuel and only one input bus is required<br/>(any will do), as well as only one output bus (reactor<br/>automatically compresses every 64 burned pellets into<br/>one ball, so you need 6 slots or more to avoid problems<br/>with voiding at full capacity).\n\nReactor requires only<br/>72k out of 720k pebbles to operate, but running at<br/>minimum capacity means that you will not get any bonuses,<br/>such as lower recipe time and higher amount of pebbles<br/>processed per cycle.\n\nThis multi consumes 1A LuV when<br/>operating, no matter how many pebbles are inside, but<br/>it also generates Hot Coolant as it runs. If you use<br/>it to generate power, you will gain more EU than is<br/>consumed by the reactor. \n\nIn this reactor, the throughput<br/>increases with the amount of pebbles put into it.\n\nBy<br/>typing HTGR in NEI, you can see all the items that<br/>are related to this multiblock.<br/><br/>"

Sometimes things can<br/>sneak in there without you noticing, like a Thaumcraft<br/>light orb!\n\nMake sure your muffler faces \u00a7lout\u00a7r, not<br/>\u00a7lin\u00a7r. The EBF can't work if it is not spreading those<br/>delightful odors!\n\nWhen placing your power hatches,<br/>make sure to minimize the distance between any generators<br/>and the EBF. Especially at LV, those few blocks make<br/>a big difference! Every amp of energy traveling over<br/>a cable loses a little bit - and you'll need as much<br/>as you can get! Your best setup is to put two generators<br/>right next to each hatch, with a 2A cable. If you're<br/>poor, you could use 2 battery buffers with 2 batteries<br/>each directly attached to each hatch. Make sure to<br/>top off the buffers' generators. If you make 9 slot<br/>battery buffers, you can fill them up over time to<br/>get longer running time until you get stable power.\n\nOutput<br/>hatches and buses will automatically push into tanks<br/>and inventories placed next to them such as chests<br/>or BC tanks. They will also void if they're full, so<br/>keep an eye on them!\n\nWhen building multiple EBFs,<br/>the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace can share<br/>walls. This can save you on input and output hatches<br/>too. Not recommended for energy and maintenance hatches!<br/><br/>"
