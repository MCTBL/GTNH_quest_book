This path is the fastest with only two steps<br/>to obtain the Thorium 232, but requires borax which<br/>can only be obtained (for now) through mining salt<br/>veins as a byproduct or through bees (probably the<br/>better option if you already have some).\n\nThe second<br/>path is a six step processing chain that requires Chemical<br/>Reactors, a Centrifuge, and an EBF. Even though it<br/>is longer it offers much better conversion ratio (75%<br/>instead of 25% in chemical plant), instead of borax<br/>it requires nitric acid (4000L per dust if you account<br/>for recycling) and 100L of fluorine per dust.\n\nEither<br/>way I would recommend using AE2FC as it allows on demand<br/>fluid crafting which will assist in both processing<br/>chains.\n"
