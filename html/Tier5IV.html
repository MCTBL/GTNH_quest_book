This path is the fastest with only two steps to<br/>obtain the Thorium 232, but requires borax which can only be obtained (for<br/>now) through mining salt veins as a byproduct or through bees (probably<br/>the better option if you already have some).\n\nThe second path is a six<br/>step processing chain that requires Chemical Reactors, a Centrifuge, and<br/>an EBF. Even though it is longer it offers much better conversion ratio<br/>(75% instead of 25% in chemical plant), instead of borax it requires nitric<br/>acid (4000L per dust if you account for recycling) and 100L of fluorine<br/>per dust.\n\nEither way I would recommend using AE2FC as it allows on demand<br/>fluid crafting which will assist in both processing chains.\n"
