This happens to villagers as well.\n\nAnimals will prioritize<br/>moving towards grass blocks over any other blocks, and if there's no grass<br/>blocks around, they prefer lit blocks over dark blocks. You can encourage<br/>animals to stay in pens, or at least not crowd the edges, by removing grass<br/>from around both sides of the fence and under it, and by placing a torch<br/>in the center of the pen. For sheep that need the grass to eat, which reduces<br/>time to mature and replaces sheared wool instantly, place it in the center<br/>of a cleared out area with a border of non-grass.\n\nAlso, large quantities<br/>can cause server lag, especially if they are bumping into each other a<br/>lot. So if you are in multiplayer, make sure you limit animals to no more<br/>than roughly one per block for small entities like chickens and one per<br/>two blocks for large entities like cows.\n\nAs an alternative, most animal<br/>and mob drops can be obtained from less laggy IC2 crop farms."

Good plants to start with are flowers, wheat, cactus and<br/>sugarcane. \n\nMake a plot of farmland with your tool and place water in<br/>the middle.

Then place<br/>the seeds on the sticks and wait a bit.\n\nWhen they are almost fully grown<br/>you can put double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop sticks<br/>once more on already placed crop sticks. This center area can now grow<br/>new crops, even new species.\n\nWith some luck you might get a new unknown<br/>seed which can be scanned later.\n\nWeeds need to be removed with a trowel<br/>or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown by them.\n\nUsing 3x1<br/>plots is easy and not much work.  Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove<br/>weeds and gather new seeds.

But this requires<br/>more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole field.\n\nNote that<br/>the more crops next to the double crop stick the faster new plants will<br/>show up, up to 4 obviously. This is also the way to get new versions of<br/>the same plant, you can't do it with just one parent like Agricraft.\n\nDon't<br/>leave new crops in these intensive fields. Pull them out and hopefully<br/>get a seedbag. Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't require<br/>babysitting.
