Good plants to start with<br/>are flowers, wheat, cactus and sugarcane. \n\nMake a<br/>plot of farmland with your tool and place water in<br/>the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a<br/>row of dirt or cobble.

This<br/>center area can now grow new crops, even new species.\n\nWith<br/>some luck you might get a new unknown seed which can<br/>be scanned later.\n\nWeeds need to be removed with a<br/>trowel or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown<br/>by them.\n\nUsing 3x1 plots is easy and not much work.<br/> Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove weeds and<br/>gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one<br/>or two seeds. \n\nIf you find a really nice seed, you<br/>can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the nice seed in the middle<br/>and others next to it for crossing. But this requires<br/>more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole<br/>field.\n\nNote that the more crops next to the double<br/>crop stick the faster new plants will show up, up to<br/>4 obviously. This is also the way to get new versions<br/>of the same plant, you can't do it with just one parent<br/>like Agricraft.\n\nDon't leave new crops in these intensive<br/>fields.
