Wider trees have more<br/>leaves and logs, but will also need more saplings to begin growing. All<br/>saplings must be the same species and girth. The sapling in the NW corner<br/>determines the stats of the new tree, and is where bone meal must be applied<br/>to mature the tree. The Giant Sequoia is best here too.\n\nAllele/Size\n1x1\n2x2\n3x3\n4x4<br/>\n\nYield: chances of getting a fruit from a destroyed leaf.
