All saplings must<br/>be the same species and girth. The sapling in the NW<br/>corner determines the stats of the new tree, and is<br/>where bone meal must be applied to mature the tree.<br/>The Giant Sequoia is best here too.\n\nAllele/Size\n1x1\n2x2\n3x3\n4x4<br/>\n\nYield: chances of getting a fruit from a destroyed<br/>leaf.

Each fruit/nut<br/>provides different advantages:\nPlum and Cherry Plum<br/>only produces 100L Fruit Juice, but have a 60% chance<br/>of producing Mulch in the Fluid Extractor or Squeezer.\nPapaya<br/>produces 600L Fruit Juice, but only has a 10% chance<br/>to produce Mulch.\nCoconuts produce 300L Seed Oil, but<br/>only have a 25% chance to produce Mulch.\nUse a Forestry<br/>Multifarm so you don't have to break the leaf block<br/>to get the fruit/nut. Set it to Manual Orchard, and<br/>place everything first.\n\n\u00a7bFamily\u00a7r: Tells you what<br/>family of the fruit listed under the Fruits trait is:<br/>Pomes, Prunes, Nuts or Jungle.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"
