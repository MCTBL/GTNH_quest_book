The bio<br/>mainframe was pretty much the end of GT:NH progression<br/>at the time, not much above UHV existed or was craftable.<br/>This was also the point in the pack where you'd start<br/>scaling for stargate, as that too was tiered at UHV.<br/>Technically UEV parts were craftable, but their only<br/>uses were singleblocks for PAs (which only held up<br/>to 16 UEV machines) and the Deep Dark Portal. UEV-UMV<br/>energy hatches were craftable, but their recipes were<br/>simple hull + wire crafting table recipes \n...and that<br/>was about it for UHV+ content. \nWith the recent addition<br/>of void miners, the previously thought to be impossible<br/>started to seem actually attainable, a set of stargates.<br/>Specifically, to \u00a7ocraft\u00a73 a set of them, not just<br/>find them like others have before. \n\nOne group in particular,<br/>known as the \u00a7aGigaplex\u00a73, gave it their all and actually<br/>managed to do it, to prove that crafting stargates<br/>is possible with enough determination.\n\nThus, on the<br/>\u00a7a16th of February, 2021\u00a73, the first set of crafted<br/>stargates had been born.\n\nP.S.: If you want to be as<br/>faithful to the challenge as possible, try completing<br/>this quest without using any of the modern functionality<br/>that didn't exist back then.\nHere's a non-exhaustive<br/>list of major things that didnt exist (in no particular<br/>order):\n-PCB Factory, Space Elevator, Component Assemblyline,<br/>AAL, PrAss, EEC, EIG, Compact Fusions, MCR, MABS\n-Any<br/>bee related GT machines\n-Any UEV or above multis\n-XL<br/>Turbines, Naq fuel, LEG\n-Sub 1-tick OC, Batch Mode,<br/>inbuilt Void Protection on multis\n-PAs with more than<br/>64 parallel (they automatically downtiered to UHV if<br/>you used UEV machines)\n-Level Maintainer, AE Fluid<br/>Crafting, Stocking Buses/Hatches, Crafting Input Buses,<br/>ME Output Buses/Hatches, non-recursive AE component<br/>recipes\n-Shift clicking recipes into AE patterns (pain)\n-Early-Midgame<br/>QoL such as ghost circuits, visual prospecting, reprogramming<br/>circuits with a screwdriver, seeing Assline recipes<br/>in NEI before having crafted them, and more\n\nP.P.S:<br/>This quest is missing the chaotic capacitors on purpose,<br/>because the chaotic core recipe requires spacetime<br/>now, but the chaotic capacitor recipe did not change<br/>at all since then. All in all the cost for these banks<br/>was completely negligible back then and still is today,<br/>they only serve as a magic gate for SG.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Every machine that your Assembly<br/>Line has crafted works, but the most advanced ones<br/>so far seem to be... a bit rough around the edges.<br/>Further inspection revealed that Indalloy just isn't<br/>good enough. It seems that Infinity's neverending vibrations<br/>destabilize the joints where the soldering happens,<br/>your living circuits have been offering resistance<br/>to this crude soldering alloy, however that happens...\n\nIt's<br/>likely that new materials will completely break Indalloy's<br/>ability to get pieces soldered together. Because of<br/>that, it's about time for a new development in this<br/>technology, and the previous rejection by your living<br/>circuits has given you an excellent idea. Any new material<br/>can have some new behavior that will ruin assembling<br/>for you, but what if the solder itself learns about<br/>these complications and learns how to adjust to them,<br/>mutating for them?\n\nThat's right: \u00a7aMutated Living<br/>Solder\u00a7r.\n\nThis sort of chemistry is only possible<br/>in a full-scale Chemical Plant, equipped with the most<br/>advanced casing: Botmium. On top of that, the catalyst<br/>you need to use has been consumed so thoroughly that<br/>you were forced to use Infinity for it, on top of the<br/>mutating Naquadria. Your Infinity will be lost to the<br/>crafting, still, unless you manage to put [note]Tungstensteel<br/>Pipe Casings[/note] and [warn]Awakened Draconium Coils[/warn]<br/>in your Chemical Plant, which prevent the catalyst<br/>from losing durability. Any better coils also have<br/>the same effect.\n\nThe new solder itself is a different<br/>story. Wetware technology is too primitive for this,<br/>and your Bio Cells have refused to bond with any fluid<br/>that would serve as its carrier for soldering. When<br/>you tried a mixture of hot Tin and Bismuth, it finally<br/>worked, but the soldering didn't actually work. It<br/>looked like the Bio Cells hadn't learned how to fulfill<br/>their new job, which could be fixed by adding an example<br/>material as a test subject, something simpler like<br/>Infinity Catalyst... but it seemed impossible to bond<br/>the cells to the dust. You need more energy... not<br/>just loads of EU, something concentrated, hot, fizzling<br/>with energy!\n\nYes, everything alive died instantly<br/>when you decided to add plasmas instead of hot fluids.<br/>No surprise there. However, Bio Cells did survive inside<br/>hot fluids, so we just need some temperature control<br/>here, and some separation between cell and plasma...<br/>yes, Gravi Stars can be used for this. We still need<br/>to cool down the plasmas, so that the enhanced cells<br/>can mix with them in liquid form, and EU alone would<br/>be too expensive. Gelid Cryotheum has proven to be<br/>surprisingly efficient, perhaps due to its origins,<br/>as a component of a living being, the Blizz.\n\nThere<br/>we go! The Mutated Living Solder is now complete. The<br/>highly intelligent Bio Cells are energized by the concentrated<br/>heat of the plasmas, while keeping a distance from<br/>them due to the Gravi Stars' influence, and they analyze<br/>the Infinity Catalyst Dust to learn about material<br/>instability. This is a very slow process, but it happens<br/>at the same time as the plasmas are slowly cooled,<br/>using Cryotheum and EU, until the learning process<br/>is complete and the Bio Cells fall into the Tin and<br/>Bismuth, now in the liquid form that was shown to work<br/>before. Finally, armed with their new knowledge, the<br/>cells flow through the Naquadria-based, Infinity-reinforced<br/>catalyst so that they can mutate in real-time after<br/>researching the material they're soldering.\n\nThis should<br/>work for any future soldering need, regardless of material.<br/>Let's hope so, at least...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

And don't complain that Barnarda should<br/>be Barnard, we can't fix it.\n\nThe Barnarda system is<br/>to the NNW, and you can visit Barnada C, E, and F.\nThe<br/>\u03b1 Centauri system is to the NE, and you can vist \u03b1<br/>Centauri Bb (Proxima Centauri is not visitable). [note]Remember<br/>to wear your SpaceSuit![/note]\nThe Tau Ceti system<br/>is to the SSW, and you can visit the habitable planet<br/>Tau Ceti E.\nThe Vega System is to the WNW, and you<br/>can visit the planet Vega B.\n\nThe new veins are Cadmium<br/>and Samarium. The ores are Cadmium, Caesium, Cerium,<br/>Lanthanum, Neodymium, Samarium, and Tartarite.\n\nYou<br/>can get Awakened Draconium from small ores on Barnarda<br/>E, Barnarda F, Tau Ceti E, and Vega B.\nYou can get<br/>Bedrockium from small ores on Barnarda F.\nYou can get<br/>Infinity Catalyst from small ores on Vega B.\n\nIn addition<br/>to planet ores and blocks, grab some Barnarda C Saplings<br/>and Dirt so you can grow some more if you need it for<br/>Radox (lol). You can also grab some more Unknown Crystal<br/>Shards from the Rainbow Crystals lying around.\n\nMore<br/>importantly you should collect Seaweed from Tau Ceti<br/>E. You need it to make UEV circuits, and though you<br/>can make it as well, you need some to begin with. The<br/>unknown liquid to grow these is however found in lakes<br/>and underground on Barnarda C.<br/>"
