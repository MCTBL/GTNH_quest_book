The bio mainframe was pretty<br/>much the end of GT:NH progression at the time, not much above UHV existed<br/>or was craftable. This was also the point in the pack where you'd start<br/>scaling for stargate, as that too was tiered at UHV. Technically UEV parts<br/>were craftable, but their only uses were singleblocks for PAs (which only<br/>held up to 16 UEV machines) and the Deep Dark Portal. UEV-UMV energy hatches<br/>were craftable, but their recipes were simple hull + wire crafting table<br/>recipes \n...and that was about it for UHV+ content. \nWith the recent addition<br/>of void miners, the previously thought to be impossible started to seem<br/>actually attainable, a set of stargates. Specifically, to craft a set of<br/>them, not just find them like others have before. \n\nOne group in particular,<br/>known as the Gigaplex, gave it their all and actually managed to do it,<br/>to prove that crafting stargates is possible with enough determination.\n\nThus,<br/>on the 16th of February, 2021, the first set of crafted stargates had been<br/>born.\n\nP.S.: If you want to be as faithful to the challenge as possible,<br/>try completing this quest without using any of the modern functionality<br/>that didn't exist back then.\nHere's a non-exhaustive list of major things<br/>that didnt exist (in no particular order):\n-PCB Factory, Space Elevator,<br/>Component Assemblyline, AAL, PrAss, EEC, EIG, Compact Fusions, MCR, MABS\n-Any<br/>bee related GT machines\n-Any UEV or above multis\n-XL Turbines, Naq fuel,<br/>LEG\n-Sub 1-tick OC, Batch Mode, inbuilt Void Protection on multis\n-PAs<br/>with more than 64 parallel (they automatically downtiered to UHV if you<br/>used UEV machines)\n-Level Maintainer, AE Fluid Crafting, Stocking Buses/Hatches,<br/>Crafting Input Buses, ME Output Buses/Hatches, non-recursive AE component<br/>recipes\n-Shift clicking recipes into AE patterns (pain)\n-Early-Midgame<br/>QoL such as ghost circuits, visual prospecting, reprogramming circuits<br/>with a screwdriver, seeing Assline recipes in NEI before having crafted<br/>them, and more\n\nP.P.S: This quest is missing the chaotic capacitors on<br/>purpose, because the chaotic core recipe requires spacetime now, but the<br/>chaotic capacitor recipe did not change at all since then. All in all the<br/>cost for these banks was completely negligible back then and still is today,<br/>they only serve as a magic gate for SG.<br/>"

Every machine that your Assembly Line has crafted works, but the<br/>most advanced ones so far seem to be... a bit rough around the edges. Further<br/>inspection revealed that Indalloy just isn't good enough. It seems that<br/>Infinity's neverending vibrations destabilize the joints where the soldering<br/>happens, your living circuits have been offering resistance to this crude<br/>soldering alloy, however that happens...\n\nIt's likely that new materials<br/>will completely break Indalloy's ability to get pieces soldered together.<br/>Because of that, it's about time for a new development in this technology,<br/>and the previous rejection by your living circuits has given you an excellent<br/>idea. Any new material can have some new behavior that will ruin assembling<br/>for you, but what if the solder itself learns about these complications<br/>and learns how to adjust to them, mutating for them?\n\nThat's right: Mutated<br/>Living Solder.\n\nThis sort of chemistry is only possible in a full-scale<br/>Chemical Plant, equipped with the most advanced casing: Botmium. On top<br/>of that, the catalyst you need to use has been consumed so thoroughly that<br/>you were forced to use Infinity for it, on top of the mutating Naquadria.<br/>Your Infinity will be lost to the crafting, still, unless you manage to<br/>put [note]Tungstensteel Pipe Casings[/note] and [warn]Awakened Draconium<br/>Coils[/warn] in your Chemical Plant, which prevent the catalyst from losing<br/>durability. Any better coils also have the same effect.\n\nThe new solder<br/>itself is a different story. Wetware technology is too primitive for this,<br/>and your Bio Cells have refused to bond with any fluid that would serve<br/>as its carrier for soldering. When you tried a mixture of hot Tin and Bismuth,<br/>it finally worked, but the soldering didn't actually work. It looked like<br/>the Bio Cells hadn't learned how to fulfill their new job, which could<br/>be fixed by adding an example material as a test subject, something simpler<br/>like Infinity Catalyst... but it seemed impossible to bond the cells to<br/>the dust. You need more energy... not just loads of EU, something concentrated,<br/>hot, fizzling with energy!\n\nYes, everything alive died instantly when you<br/>decided to add plasmas instead of hot fluids. No surprise there. However,<br/>Bio Cells did survive inside hot fluids, so we just need some temperature<br/>control here, and some separation between cell and plasma... yes, Gravi<br/>Stars can be used for this. We still need to cool down the plasmas, so<br/>that the enhanced cells can mix with them in liquid form, and EU alone<br/>would be too expensive. Gelid Cryotheum has proven to be surprisingly efficient,<br/>perhaps due to its origins, as a component of a living being, the Blizz.\n\nThere<br/>we go! The Mutated Living Solder is now complete. The highly intelligent<br/>Bio Cells are energized by the concentrated heat of the plasmas, while<br/>keeping a distance from them due to the Gravi Stars' influence, and they<br/>analyze the Infinity Catalyst Dust to learn about material instability.<br/>This is a very slow process, but it happens at the same time as the plasmas<br/>are slowly cooled, using Cryotheum and EU, until the learning process is<br/>complete and the Bio Cells fall into the Tin and Bismuth, now in the liquid<br/>form that was shown to work before. Finally, armed with their new knowledge,<br/>the cells flow through the Naquadria-based, Infinity-reinforced catalyst<br/>so that they can mutate in real-time after researching the material they're<br/>soldering.\n\nThis should work for any future soldering need, regardless<br/>of material. Let's hope so, at least...<br/><br/>"
