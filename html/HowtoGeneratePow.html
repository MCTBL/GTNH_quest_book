You might have built a few of them here. What do they all<br/>have in common, I ask you... they generate either Steam or EU directly<br/>from sunlight, and that is not efficient. There's something that everybody<br/>forgot!\n\nSingleblock solar panels are best to insert anywhere that has<br/>sun, and provide constant power to a machine. However, EU storage and transport<br/>are easy here, so why not build something better? Instead of generating<br/>energy directly, send those warm beams of sunlight into a central structure<br/>with circles of Solar Reflectors, and bask in the eternal power of the<br/>biggest fusion reactor in the Solar System!\n\n(If you end up making a bigger<br/>one, don't come arguing to me about this. Be quiet.)\n\nThe whole idea is<br/>that the energy of the Sun's rays is directed towards a fluid that can<br/>retain the energy, a Solar Salt that does it far better than water. The<br/>Solar Tower transfers heat to all the fluid inside it, but watch out! If<br/>there's too much cold Solar Salt inside, it will drain away all the heat<br/>and slow down the entire process.\n\nIn more detail, the Solar Tower has<br/>a heat value that ranges from 0 to 100000, and it only heats up Solar Salt<br/>at 30000 or above. The amount of heat gained per cycle depends on the number<br/>of Reflectors, but also the current heat value: this process is optimal<br/>at exactly half the maximum, so 50000 heat. To get a perfect tower setup,<br/>you have to slowly feed cold Solar Salt to maintain this heat value, taking<br/>away just enough heat to keep it there. I'll let you figure out what the<br/>flow rate is, given that it depends on how many Reflectors you have.\n\nFrom<br/>there, generate Steam or SH Steam by heat-exchanging in the same way as<br/>Hot Coolant does it.

If you've unlocked fusion, you can start this questline, but<br/>keep in mind that it's divided into three segments (the three fusion chains):<br/>one for each tier of Fusion Reactor, from Mk1 to Mk3.\n\nThere is a spreadsheet<br/>for all these chains, although it has some reactor count numbers that aren't<br/>right. To see it, check the Excel spreadsheet that set these numbers, in<br/>the following Github link:[url]https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GTplusplus/pull/669[/url]\n\nThese<br/>quests follow the process of creating some truly powerful plasmas that<br/>are useful for power generation at the beginning of endgame, when you've<br/>scaled up your setup to a Compact Fusion Reactor and XL Plasma Turbines.<br/>As you might have seen before, those huge turbines can go very fast with<br/>good materials, like Trinium or Infinity, but they will apply EU/t penalties<br/>according to the fuel value of the plasma used. This means that Helium<br/>and Tin Plasma are both much weaker there than they were in Large Plasma<br/>Turbines.\n\nThe end product of this whole process is Celestial Tungsten<br/>Plasma, which has no penalties even at Spacetime and can somewhat match<br/>what Helium Plasma would have produced, per compact reactor. The last step<br/>is the slowest, but, if there are no other bottlenecks, you can expect<br/>around over 8 billion EU/t assuming a single compact doing the last step<br/>with huge infinity turbines in a plasma XL.\n\nHowever, getting there won't<br/>be easy. This whole process uses 15 fusion recipes in total, and a lot<br/>more material automation than any of the simple fusion setups. This questline<br/>will help explain what is simple, not simple, or possibly a bottleneck.<br/>If you complete this, you will be sustained in powergen until the Dyson<br/>Swarm, or whatever other option appears later on, and it will continue<br/>being useful later on!"

This Large Steam Turbine can<br/>help you produce a tremendous amount of energy. It will also distill water<br/>for you, so you can use the same water again inside your Large Boiler.<br/>Don't forget to make a rotor for the turbine and put inside the controller,<br/>otherwise this multiblock won't do anything.\n\nEach turbine has a specific<br/>optimal flow, the Steam flow that gives the highest fuel efficiency, the<br/>value shown on the turbine's tooltip. This is the flow you want to match,<br/>and you can use a Fluid Regulator as a cover to make it exactly what you<br/>want, but you can go beyond this flow to get an even higher EU/t value,<br/>at a loss of fuel efficiency. You can make turbines in 4 different sizes,<br/>with larger turbines producing more EU/t, but with variying amounts of<br/>fuel efficiency. Generally, Large is the best due to having the highest<br/>fuel efficiency and a good optimal flow rate\n\nWhen using turbines, be careful<br/>of flow rates. To find the optimal flow rate, you divide the optimal energy<br/>flow rate listed on the turbine, by the energy value for the plasma. You<br/>can also use the Large Turbine Calculator (there's a link on the main spreadsheet,<br/>which is linked to in discord), or scan the multiblock's controller while<br/>feeding it a minimal amount of plasma to see what the optimal flow is.<br/>Make sure to use a Fluid Regulator set to this flow rate for highest fuel<br/>efficiency, or go beyond it to get more EU/t at a cost to efficiency, with<br/>Steam Turbines being the worst at retaining efficiency beyond the optimal<br/>flow.\n\nIf you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value,<br/>but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine<br/>type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1<br/>reaches the max at 150% of optimal flow to produce 112% of the EU/t, tier<br/>2 reaches the max at 200% of optimal flow to produce 133% of the EU/t and<br/>tier 3 reaches the max at 250% of optimal flow to produce 156% of the EU/t.<br/>The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing<br/>away. Don't exceed your dynamo hatch's maximum EU/t output, though, or<br/>you will have problems!\n\nTurbines with a small turbine durability below<br/>75k have their recipes removed. Use NEI with the appropriate long rod to<br/>find assembler recipes that will work for you. Or the spreadsheet. Long<br/>magnalium for small turbines, long titanium for normal turbines, etc.\n\nPre-moon,<br/>the best rotors are Shadow Metal or Vibrant Alloy.\n\nPost-moon, the best<br/>HV rotors are Shadow Metal or Oriharukon (this is IV-tier). Luckily, turbines<br/>are now fully functional with multi-amp dynamos, so give those a try if<br/>you need extra amps!\n\nFor additional choices, see the spreadsheet and Large<br/>Turbine Calculator.<br/>"
