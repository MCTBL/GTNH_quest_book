This step requires<br/>you to preferably automate it with ABS, and have a<br/>steady supply of Thorium 232.\n\nIf you look at the last<br/>recipe, you'll see it's 144L Neon Plasma input to 1000L<br/>Force Plasma output. This multiplying makes it so that<br/>step, and all final steps, are the slowest ones. You<br/>will need 0.144 Neon Plasma reactors for every Force<br/>Plasma reactor, which means that 1 Neon reactor feeds<br/>nearly 7 Force reactors (6.9444... reactors, more precisely).\n\nOnce<br/>you get Force Plasma, this is the end of the mk1 fusion<br/>chain. Force Plasma is a 150M fuel value plasma, which<br/>means it has a 53.5% penalty with Infinity Catalyst<br/>in XL Plasma Generators. This is better than Helium<br/>Plasma with its 86.1% penalty but still not great for<br/>power generation. You probably don't need this in ZPM,<br/>but it'll be a stepping stone for your future progression.<br/><br/>"

You might have built a few of them<br/>here. What do they all have in common, I ask you...<br/>they generate either Steam or EU directly from sunlight,<br/>and that is not efficient. There's something that everybody<br/>forgot!\n\nSingleblock solar panels are best to insert<br/>anywhere that has sun, and provide constant power to<br/>a machine. However, EU storage and transport are easy<br/>here, so why not build something better? Instead of<br/>generating energy directly, send those warm beams of<br/>sunlight into a central structure with circles of Solar<br/>Reflectors, and bask in the eternal power of the biggest<br/>fusion reactor in the Solar System!\n\n(If you end up<br/>making a bigger one, don't come arguing to me about<br/>this. Be quiet.)\n\nThe whole idea is that the energy<br/>of the Sun's rays is directed towards a fluid that<br/>can retain the energy, a Solar Salt that does it far<br/>better than water. The Solar Tower transfers heat to<br/>all the fluid inside it, but watch out! If there's<br/>too much cold Solar Salt inside, it will drain away<br/>all the heat and slow down the entire process.\n\nIn<br/>more detail, the Solar Tower has a heat value that<br/>ranges from 0 to 100000, and it only heats up Solar<br/>Salt at 30000 or above. The amount of heat gained per<br/>cycle depends on the number of Reflectors, but also<br/>the current heat value: this process is optimal at<br/>exactly half the maximum, so 50000 heat. To get a perfect<br/>tower setup, you have to slowly feed cold Solar Salt<br/>to maintain this heat value, taking away just enough<br/>heat to keep it there. I'll let you figure out what<br/>the flow rate is, given that it depends on how many<br/>Reflectors you have.\n\nFrom there, generate Steam or<br/>SH Steam by heat-exchanging in the same way as Hot<br/>Coolant does it.

To<br/>see it, check the Excel spreadsheet that set these<br/>numbers, in the following Github link:[url]https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GTplusplus/pull/669[/url]\n\nThese<br/>quests follow the process of creating some truly powerful<br/>plasmas that are useful for power generation at the<br/>beginning of endgame, when you've scaled up your setup<br/>to a Compact Fusion Reactor and XL Plasma Turbines.<br/>As you might have seen before, those huge turbines<br/>can go very fast with good materials, like Trinium<br/>or Infinity, but they will apply EU/t penalties according<br/>to the fuel value of the plasma used. This means that<br/>Helium and Tin Plasma are both much weaker there than<br/>they were in Large Plasma Turbines.\n\nThe end product<br/>of this whole process is Celestial Tungsten Plasma,<br/>which has no penalties even at Spacetime and can somewhat<br/>match what Helium Plasma would have produced, per compact<br/>reactor. The last step is the slowest, but, if there<br/>are no other bottlenecks, you can expect around \u00a72\u00a7lover<br/>8 billion EU/t\u00a7r assuming a single compact doing the<br/>last step with huge infinity turbines in a plasma XL.\n\nHowever,<br/>getting there won't be easy.

This Large Steam Turbine can help you produce<br/>a tremendous amount of energy. It will also distill<br/>water for you, so you can use the same water again<br/>inside your Large Boiler. Don't forget to make a rotor<br/>for the turbine and put inside the controller, otherwise<br/>this multiblock won't do anything.\n\nEach turbine has<br/>a specific optimal flow, the Steam flow that gives<br/>the highest fuel efficiency, the value shown on the<br/>turbine's tooltip. This is the flow you want to match,<br/>and you can use a Fluid Regulator as a cover to make<br/>it exactly what you want, but you can go beyond this<br/>flow to get an even higher EU/t value, at a loss of<br/>fuel efficiency. You can make turbines in 4 different<br/>sizes, with larger turbines producing more EU/t, but<br/>with variying amounts of fuel efficiency. Generally,<br/>Large is the best due to having the highest fuel efficiency<br/>and a good optimal flow rate\n\nWhen using turbines,<br/>be careful of flow rates. To find the optimal flow<br/>rate, you divide the optimal energy flow rate listed<br/>on the turbine, by the energy value for the plasma.<br/>You can also use the Large Turbine Calculator (there's<br/>a link on the main spreadsheet, which is linked to<br/>in discord), or scan the multiblock's controller while<br/>feeding it a minimal amount of plasma to see what the<br/>optimal flow is. Make sure to use a Fluid Regulator<br/>set to this flow rate for highest fuel efficiency,<br/>or go beyond it to get more EU/t at a cost to efficiency,<br/>with Steam Turbines being the worst at retaining efficiency<br/>beyond the optimal flow.\n\nIf you go beyond the optimal<br/>flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel<br/>efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the<br/>turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For<br/>this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 150%<br/>of optimal flow to produce 112% of the EU/t, tier 2<br/>reaches the max at 200% of optimal flow to produce<br/>133% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 250%<br/>of optimal flow to produce 156% of the EU/t. The closer<br/>you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're<br/>throwing away. Don't exceed your dynamo hatch's maximum<br/>EU/t output, though, or you will have problems!\n\nTurbines<br/>with a small turbine durability below 75k have their<br/>recipes removed. Use NEI with the appropriate long<br/>rod to find assembler recipes that will work for you.<br/>Or the spreadsheet. Long magnalium for small turbines,<br/>long titanium for normal turbines, etc.\n\nPre-moon,<br/>the best rotors are Shadow Metal or Vibrant Alloy.\n\nPost-moon,<br/>the best HV rotors are Shadow Metal or Oriharukon (this<br/>is IV-tier). Luckily, turbines are now fully functional<br/>with multi-amp dynamos, so give those a try if you<br/>need extra amps!\n\nFor additional choices, see the spreadsheet<br/>and Large Turbine Calculator.<br/><br/><br/>"

However, this XL now applies an<br/>EU/t penalty to its production by comparing the fuel<br/>value of the plasma it processes with the rotor material<br/>it has inside.\n\nSee [url]https://i.imgur.com/vifsk0P.png[/url]<br/>for various combinations of plasmas and materials.<br/>Mk1 plasmas are in green, Mk2 in yellow and Mk3 in<br/>red. The bottom 3 are the final plasmas of the fusion<br/>chains.\n\nThe formula is a bit complicated, but here<br/>are some important values:\n\n-> Helium Plasma receives<br/>a huge penalty of 86.1% even with Infinity Catalyst,<br/>whereas Tin's penalty is only 53.5%, which means that<br/>the number of reactors and XLs with this material is<br/>twice the expected amount if using Tin Plasma;\n-> Trinium<br/>changes these numbers to 92.4% and 74.5%, respectively;\n-><br/>Infinity further increases the penalty to 97.4% and<br/>91.1%;\n-> Spacetime sets these values to 98.3% and<br/>94.4%.\n\nThis means that, at the UHV/UEV stage, you<br/>will no longer be able to rely on these two plasmas<br/>with your XLs. For 1-recipe plasmas, your best option<br/>is the mk3 Americium Plasma, which has an insignificant<br/>0.8% penalty with Infinity. If you want faster powergen<br/>than that, check out the complete fusion chain that<br/>ends at Celestial Tungsten Plasma, which has no penalties<br/>in the XL Plasma Turbine and has total EU/t numbers<br/>compared to Helium's old ones. Check below for quests<br/>regarding the fusion chains.<br/><br/>"
