To fully analyze a seed bag, you will need<br/>to put it through the cropnalyzer four times. If the<br/>crop is already planted, it is better to analyze it<br/>with the portable scanner instead of breaking it just<br/>to scan it - you have a chance of losing the seed every<br/>time you break it.\n\nThe cropnalyzer also has a feature<br/>called the IC2 Crop Calculator, where you can find<br/>the mix of outputs of breeding together any crops.<br/>To access the calculator, hit the IC2 side inventory<br/>key while holding the cropnalyzer.  You can select<br/>any crops available and discover what plants have decent<br/>percentages of a result. And no, you can't do the reverse,<br/>search for the crops.zip on discord for that (it doesn't<br/>have micadia though).\n\nYou can choose up to four crops<br/>to breed together. Then click \"process\" and the bottom<br/>row will show the possible crossbreeding outputs, and<br/>their weights. You can use the + and - gui buttons<br/>to scroll through the row(s) of crops. You can also<br/>use a button in the GUI to sort the rows by tier or<br/>weight. You can invert the sorting by hitting the sorting<br/>button while holding shift.\n\nWhen trying to get a specific<br/>crop, you generally want to maximize its percentage.<br/>Do this by breeding 2-4 of the same plant together<br/>(more is faster). There is no advantage to crossing<br/>plant types, it just reduces the % chance of getting<br/>what you want, contrary to what you might think.\n\nUse<br/>the crops guide at [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/IC2_Crops_List[/url]<br/>for more details.\n\nA large field of stickreeds has<br/>a good chance at making lots of valuable crosses. This<br/>is because it's decently high tier (they randomly mutate<br/>to tiers nearby mostly), and it's really fast, so you<br/>can get it to a high stat fast, which you should probably<br/>do first. Mutations are random, you can get transformium<br/>from stickreed, so keep that in mind. You do tend to<br/>get similar crops, so if you want metals, get the metal<br/>crops for example. Go to the wiki or spreadsheet (not<br/>up to date) to see the attributes that govern similarity.<br/><br/><br/>"

They're all about how much was applied,<br/>and is left of that.\n\n\u00a72Nutrients\u00a7r, \u00a71Humidity\u00a7r,<br/>and \u00a76Air Quality\u00a7r are all about the environment.<br/>They're also affected by the Fertilizer and Water stats.\n\nNutrients<br/>and Humidity are mostly about the right biome, with<br/>swamp and rainforest types (hot+humid) being the best,<br/>but you can also get some extra stats by setting up<br/>right.\n\n\u00a72Nutrients\u00a7r:\n3 possible free points from<br/>dirt under the farmland block, 2 for plants that require<br/>a specific block. So optimally always make sure that<br/>the required block is at the bottommost bottom in the<br/>column, because it checks in chain, not certain height.<br/>For example: cropstick -> farmland -> dirt -> oreblock<br/>-> dirt, it will only register 1 dirt, ignoring the<br/>one below the oreblock.\n\n5-10 possible points from<br/>fertilizing your crops. You can use fertilizer on a<br/>crop to increase its nutrients stat. Fertilizer caps<br/>at 199 which gives 10 nutrients, but can be applied<br/>again only if the crop drops below 100 fertilizer points.<br/>So for high stat crops its safe to assume and make<br/>tests for 100 fertilizer points as its a given constant<br/>unlike 199->100 values. You can apply bonemeal, IC2<br/>fertilizer and Forestry fertilizer to a crop by hand.<br/>Forestry manual orchard multifarm and crop matron does<br/>this automatically when supplied with fertilizer (the<br/>multifarm needs fertilizer to harvest crops as well).\n\n\u00a71Humidity\u00a7r:\n2<br/>free points from using dirt as farmland, as when farmland<br/>gets hydrated by water(turns darker) it gains 2 humidity<br/>points. This is why other blocks for this suck, since<br/>they don't give this bonus.\n\n10 possible points from<br/>hydrating your crop. Similiar to fertilizing, water<br/>can be applied to crop up to 200 points, which is 10<br/>humidity points, altough unlike fertilizer it does<br/>not need to drop below value of 100, water can be applied<br/>over and over keeping it at constant 200 points. You<br/>can apply water to your crop by using IC2 hydration<br/>cells by hand, or let your Forestry manual orchard<br/>multifarm and crop matron do it automatically. The<br/>multifarm needs water to harvest crops as well though.\n\n\u00a76Air<br/>Quality\u00a7r:\n4 potential free points from empty space<br/>around crop. A crop checks for empty spaces to calculate<br/>bonus air quality points, it gives up to 4 points,<br/>1 point for each 2 empty spaces. It only counts full<br/>blocks or cropsticks though. If you like looks, you'll<br/>probably have to sacrifice this.\n\n4 free points from<br/>height of your farm. You get 1 free point every 15<br/>blocks startng at Y79.\n79 - 1 point\n94 - 2 points\n109<br/>- 3 points\n124 - 4 points\n\n2 free points from no opaque<br/>blocks above the crop. You can place glass above and<br/>you won't lose the bonus since it's a transparent block.<br/>You cannot use dark glass, several layers of water,<br/>or gaseous tenebrae to get around this if your crop<br/>likes the dark. Unless you only let it grow at night<br/>I guess.\n\n\u00a7aGrowability\u00a7r:\nYour crop will require a<br/>certain level of NHA, try to reach or surpass this,<br/>or the crop will either not grow, or even die (disappear).<br/>Each crop is different, and higher tiers (and stats)<br/>require more. It's generally easy to meet though, as<br/>long as you're in a good biome.\n\nGrowability is determined<br/>by the difference between what the crop needs in terms<br/>of NHA, and what it actually has. If you have more<br/>than what you need it grows faster. This is why you<br/>don't want a maxed resistance stat, since higher stats<br/>will slow it down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Machine will<br/>take fertilizer from the input busses on start of the<br/>operation and will be applied to that operation only.<br/>Each fertilizer gives +200% per crop in normal mode<br/>or +10% in IC2 mode.

Get some Crops - the sticks,<br/>that is - and some seeds from farming with a hoe or<br/>mattock. You can also place some plants and berries<br/>directly on crop sticks. Good plants to start with<br/>are flowers, wheat, cactus and sugarcane. \n\nMake a<br/>plot of farmland with your tool and place water in<br/>the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a<br/>row of dirt or cobble. You want to be able to see the<br/>center of each column of 3x1 plots all at once, like<br/>this:\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdWdFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd<br/>\nFFFdddFFF\nNow place crop sticks in each end of the<br/>3x1 plot. Then place the seeds on the sticks and wait<br/>a bit.\n\nWhen they are almost fully grown you can put<br/>double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop<br/>sticks once more on already placed crop sticks. This<br/>center area can now grow new crops, even new species.\n\nWith<br/>some luck you might get a new unknown seed which can<br/>be scanned later.\n\nWeeds need to be removed with a<br/>trowel or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown<br/>by them.\n\nUsing 3x1 plots is easy and not much work.<br/> Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove weeds and<br/>gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one<br/>or two seeds. \n\nIf you find a really nice seed, you<br/>can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the nice seed in the middle<br/>and others next to it for crossing. But this requires<br/>more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole<br/>field.\n\nNote that the more crops next to the double<br/>crop stick the faster new plants will show up, up to<br/>4 obviously. This is also the way to get new versions<br/>of the same plant, you can't do it with just one parent<br/>like Agricraft.\n\nDon't leave new crops in these intensive<br/>fields. Pull them out and hopefully get a seedbag.<br/>Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't<br/>require babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more<br/>crossing. \n\nCrossing happens when two or more almost-mature<br/>crops are next to a double cropstick. There is a high<br/>chance of getting the same species as the parents.<br/>The rest of the time will be a mutation. For more details,<br/>check out the IC2 cropnalyzer quest.<br/><br/><br/>"
