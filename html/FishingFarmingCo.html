Charge<br/>it by placing it in an MV machine; recommended to put an MV battery in<br/>it as well to keep it full. To fully analyze a seed bag, you will need<br/>to put it through the cropnalyzer four times. If the crop is already planted,<br/>it is better to analyze it with the portable scanner instead of breaking<br/>it just to scan it - you have a chance of losing the seed every time you<br/>break it.\n\nThe cropnalyzer also has a feature called the IC2 Crop Calculator,<br/>where you can find the mix of outputs of breeding together any crops. To<br/>access the calculator, hit the IC2 side inventory key while holding the<br/>cropnalyzer.  You can select any crops available and discover what plants<br/>have decent percentages of a result. And no, you can't do the reverse,<br/>search for the crops.zip on discord for that (it doesn't have micadia though).\n\nYou<br/>can choose up to four crops to breed together. Then click \"process\" and<br/>the bottom row will show the possible crossbreeding outputs, and their<br/>weights. You can use the + and - gui buttons to scroll through the row(s)<br/>of crops. You can also use a button in the GUI to sort the rows by tier<br/>or weight. You can invert the sorting by hitting the sorting button while<br/>holding shift.\n\nWhen trying to get a specific crop, you generally want<br/>to maximize its percentage. Do this by breeding 2-4 of the same plant together<br/>(more is faster). There is no advantage to crossing plant types, it just<br/>reduces the % chance of getting what you want, contrary to what you might<br/>think.\n\nUse the crops guide at [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/IC2_Crops_List[/url]<br/>for more details.\n\nA large field of stickreeds has a good chance at making<br/>lots of valuable crosses. This is because it's decently high tier (they<br/>randomly mutate to tiers nearby mostly), and it's really fast, so you can<br/>get it to a high stat fast, which you should probably do first. Mutations<br/>are random, you can get transformium from stickreed, so keep that in mind.<br/>You do tend to get similar crops, so if you want metals, get the metal<br/>crops for example. Go to the wiki or spreadsheet (not up to date) to see<br/>the attributes that govern similarity.<br/>"

They're all about how much was applied, and is left of that.\n\nNutrients,<br/>Humidity, and Air Quality are all about the environment. They're also affected<br/>by the Fertilizer and Water stats.\n\nNutrients and Humidity are mostly about<br/>the right biome, with swamp and rainforest types (hot+humid) being the<br/>best, but you can also get some extra stats by setting up right.\n\nNutrients:\n3<br/>possible free points from dirt under the farmland block, 2 for plants that<br/>require a specific block. So optimally always make sure that the required<br/>block is at the bottommost bottom in the column, because it checks in chain,<br/>not certain height. For example: cropstick -> farmland -> dirt -> oreblock<br/>-> dirt, it will only register 1 dirt, ignoring the one below the oreblock.\n\n5-10<br/>possible points from fertilizing your crops. You can use fertilizer on<br/>a crop to increase its nutrients stat. Fertilizer caps at 199 which gives<br/>10 nutrients, but can be applied again only if the crop drops below 100<br/>fertilizer points. So for high stat crops its safe to assume and make tests<br/>for 100 fertilizer points as its a given constant unlike 199->100 values.<br/>You can apply bonemeal, IC2 fertilizer and Forestry fertilizer to a crop<br/>by hand. Forestry manual orchard multifarm and crop matron does this automatically<br/>when supplied with fertilizer (the multifarm needs fertilizer to harvest<br/>crops as well).\n\nHumidity:\n2 free points from using dirt as farmland, as<br/>when farmland gets hydrated by water(turns darker) it gains 2 humidity<br/>points. This is why other blocks for this suck, since they don't give this<br/>bonus.\n\n10 possible points from hydrating your crop. Similiar to fertilizing,<br/>water can be applied to crop up to 200 points, which is 10 humidity points,<br/>altough unlike fertilizer it does not need to drop below value of 100,<br/>water can be applied over and over keeping it at constant 200 points. You<br/>can apply water to your crop by using IC2 hydration cells by hand, or let<br/>your Forestry manual orchard multifarm and crop matron do it automatically.<br/>The multifarm needs water to harvest crops as well though.\n\nAir Quality:\n4<br/>potential free points from empty space around crop. A crop checks for empty<br/>spaces to calculate bonus air quality points, it gives up to 4 points,<br/>1 point for each 2 empty spaces. It only counts full blocks or cropsticks<br/>though. If you like looks, you'll probably have to sacrifice this.\n\n4 free<br/>points from height of your farm. You get 1 free point every 15 blocks startng<br/>at Y79.\n79 - 1 point\n94 - 2 points\n109 - 3 points\n124 - 4 points\n\n2 free<br/>points from no opaque blocks above the crop. You can place glass above<br/>and you won't lose the bonus since it's a transparent block. You cannot<br/>use dark glass, several layers of water, or gaseous tenebrae to get around<br/>this if your crop likes the dark. Unless you only let it grow at night<br/>I guess.\n\nGrowability:\nYour crop will require a certain level of NHA, try<br/>to reach or surpass this, or the crop will either not grow, or even die<br/>(disappear). Each crop is different, and higher tiers (and stats) require<br/>more. It's generally easy to meet though, as long as you're in a good biome.\n\nGrowability<br/>is determined by the difference between what the crop needs in terms of<br/>NHA, and what it actually has. If you have more than what you need it grows<br/>faster. This is why you don't want a maxed resistance stat, since higher<br/>stats will slow it down.<br/><br/>"

With [note]UV[/note] glass you can<br/>have an energy tier as high as you want.\nShift click with screwdriver to<br/>change crop type (IC2/normal), sadly you can't farm both in one machine.\nThere<br/>are 3 modes to manage your crops (change with screwdriver):\n\nSetup mode<br/>(input):\nIn this mode you can plant your crops in the machine.\nJust put<br/>them in the input bus and enable the machine with a soft mallet.\nAdditionally,<br/>you need to insert block that is required for IC2 crop to grow (if any)\nWhen<br/>the bus is empty, just disable it and change the mode.\nKeep in mind that<br/>there is limited space of slots for your crops depending on the voltage.\nWith<br/>normal crops you start with 1 slot and that multiplies by 2 every tier<br/>past EV, every slot can take 64 crops of the same type.\nWith IC2 crops<br/>you start with 4 slots and that multiplies by 4 every tier past LuV, every<br/>slot can take only 1 crop.\n\nSetup mode (output):\nThis mode allows you to<br/>move your Greenhouse or upgrade your crops.\nWhen the machine is running<br/>in this mode it will output all planted crops in the output bus.\n\nNormal<br/>operation:\nWith normal crops it is a straightforward process. Base processing<br/>time is 5 seconds, at the end of operation all crops are grown and the<br/>outputs are added to the output bus. Additionally the time is lower every<br/>tier past EV (The time is divided by the number of tiers past HV, minimum<br/>1 second. WOW)\n\nIC2 crops on the other hand, are not that easy. They are<br/>normally simulated, but accelerated 32 times. Process time is 5 seconds.<br/>You can check the progress of the growing process with a tricorder.\n\nIf<br/>you want to grow your crops even faster, then you can use a fertilizer<br/>(up to 400% more drops !). Machine will take fertilizer from the input<br/>busses on start of the operation and will be applied to that operation<br/>only. Each fertilizer gives +200% per crop in normal mode or +10% in IC2<br/>mode. The bonus is applied evenly on crops. Examples:\nNormal mode, 3 wheat<br/>seeds, 1 tea seeds, you insert 1 fertilizer, you will get +150% wheat drops<br/>and +50% tea drops.\nIC2 mode, 16 melon seed bags, you insert 64 fertilizer,<br/>you will get +40% drops.\n\nAdditionally, all your crops need water to grow.<br/>Every single crop drinks 1000L per operation. So for example if you have<br/>planted 576 tea seeds at [note]UV[/note] voltage you will need 576000 L<br/>per second.\n\nLast notes:\nThe animation can\u2019t be disabled.\nThe lamps can<br/>be inverted.\nThe dirt must be tilled.\nIf you encounter any issue or have<br/>any suggestion please open an issue on github and ping @kuba6000.\nThis<br/>MB was created to farm tea because I wanted to.\n<br/>"

Get some Crops - the sticks, that is - and some seeds from farming<br/>with a hoe or mattock. You can also place some plants and berries directly<br/>on crop sticks. Good plants to start with are flowers, wheat, cactus and<br/>sugarcane. \n\nMake a plot of farmland with your tool and place water in<br/>the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a row of dirt or cobble.<br/>You want to be able to see the center of each column of 3x1 plots all at<br/>once, like this:\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdWdFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd<br/>\nFFFdddFFF\nNow place crop sticks in each end of the 3x1 plot. Then place<br/>the seeds on the sticks and wait a bit.\n\nWhen they are almost fully grown<br/>you can put double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop sticks<br/>once more on already placed crop sticks. This center area can now grow<br/>new crops, even new species.\n\nWith some luck you might get a new unknown<br/>seed which can be scanned later.\n\nWeeds need to be removed with a trowel<br/>or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown by them.\n\nUsing 3x1<br/>plots is easy and not much work.  Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove<br/>weeds and gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one or two seeds.<br/>\n\nIf you find a really nice seed, you can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the<br/>nice seed in the middle and others next to it for crossing. But this requires<br/>more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole field.\n\nNote that<br/>the more crops next to the double crop stick the faster new plants will<br/>show up, up to 4 obviously. This is also the way to get new versions of<br/>the same plant, you can't do it with just one parent like Agricraft.\n\nDon't<br/>leave new crops in these intensive fields. Pull them out and hopefully<br/>get a seedbag. Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't require<br/>babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more crossing. \n\nCrossing happens<br/>when two or more almost-mature crops are next to a double cropstick. There<br/>is a high chance of getting the same species as the parents. The rest of<br/>the time will be a mutation. For more details, check out the IC2 cropnalyzer<br/>quest."

This<br/>is only partially true. A fully grown Mandrake may scream causing immense<br/>discomfort to those around. This is why it is best to harvest the Mandrake<br/>root at night when the plant is more likely to be dormant. The fully grown<br/>Mandrake can be harvested to obtain more Mandrake seeds and a Mandrake.\n\nBreaking<br/>a fully grown Mandrake plant will either yield Mandrake Root or the Mandrake<br/>may awaken and cause all sorts of mischief (and pain to the ears!).\n\nBelladonna<br/>seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage belladonna<br/>plant. The fully grown belladonna plant can be harvested to obtain more<br/>Belladonna seeds and a Belladonna flower.\n\nSnowbell seeds can be planted<br/>and eventually grow into the multistage snowbell plant. The fully grown<br/>snowbell plant can be harvested to obtain more Snowbell seeds, snowballs<br/>and occasionally a Icy Needle.\n\nWater Artichoke seeds can be planted and<br/>eventually grow into the multistage Water Artichoke plant. The fully grown<br/>Water Artichoke plant can be harvested to obtain more Water Artichoke seeds<br/>and a Water Artichoke Globe.\n\nWater Artichoke seeds can only be planted<br/>on water source blocks.\n\nGarlic is a plantable crop that can be used to<br/>make tasty food, and to deal with vampires. It may be planted on tilled<br/>farm land, and will grow in five stages. When full grown the plant may<br/>be harvested for up to three dropped garlic bulbs. Which may either be<br/>replanted, or used in a crafting recipe.\n\nGarlic bulbs can be used to make<br/>meaty stew, a particularly nourishing meal. It is also the main ingredient<br/>in making a Garlic Garland, a useful tool in warding off vampires. Finally,<br/>garlic can be used by witches in a Witches' Cauldron to make a vampire<br/>Weakening brew, and by Witch Hunters, to make vampire resistant armor.\n\nWolfsbane<br/>seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage Wolfsbane<br/>plant.
