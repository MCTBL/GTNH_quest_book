Additionally, the bigger<br/>your Steam/EU buffer is, the less time your generators<br/>will spend heating up, which makes them more efficient.<br/>\n\nUse a Machine Controller Cover on the controller<br/>for that. You can put it on top, bottom, or sides next<br/>to a casing - casings will transmit the redstone signal.<br/>You can use a Soldering Iron and Fine Soldering Alloy<br/>Wire to set the Redstone Output of a controller block<br/>to strong. When set to Strong it can go through a casing,<br/>but not hatches, buses, or other blocks. Use it with<br/>an activity detector if you want to receive a signal<br/>from the controller rather than turning it on/off with<br/>one.\n\nWith a Machine Controller Cover, you can use<br/>redstone to turn the machine on and off. This is handy<br/>if you don't want to use a Soft Hammer to disable a<br/>machine yourself constantly.\n \nThe best way to do that<br/>is with an RS latch. One input will turn the machine<br/>on, and one input will turn the machine off. Use a<br/>comparator attached to a valve to measure the steam<br/>level in your multiblock Iron or Steel Tank. Invert<br/>the signal to turn on your boiler when the steam level<br/>is low. When the steam level signal is high, turn your<br/>boiler off. Use a trail of redstone to lower the signal<br/>strength. Because of boiler/turbine warmup, try to<br/>set the ON strength to 30 percent of capacity and OFF<br/>strength to about 90 percent.\n\nRed alloy wire will<br/>hold a redstone signal for a longer distance than normal<br/>redstone, while redstone conduits will go indefinitely.<br/>You can also use amplified redcrystal to improve the<br/>strength of the signal for a long distance, repeating<br/>as necessary. \n\nYou can use a Energy Detector Cover<br/>in Normal Electrical Storage (including batteries)<br/>mode to monitor the power in a battery buffer and use<br/>it to enable/disable generators in a similar way. Change<br/>mode using a screwdriver. If you use a dense redcrystal,<br/>it will only allow signal through at a certain level,<br/>perfect for automating this kind of thing.\n\nYou can<br/>use MCCs on more than just generators though, you can<br/>use it on any multiblock and most singleblocks. This<br/>is useful to prevent voiding of materials. Unlike GT++<br/>multies that will halt if full, a non-GT++ multi will<br/>void the items or liquids and keep on working, potentially<br/>voiding huge amounts of materials. You'll want to use<br/>them in combination with Fluid or Item Detection Covers<br/>on the output hatch or bus.\n\nFor a video version, check<br/>out this video: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPfnifJEO64[/url]<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Additional<br/>life hearts are available in the Kill all the Things<br/>tab.\n\nAside from the consume-type quests, a quest counts<br/>for everyone in the party if one person finished it.<br/>However, if someone joined your party later, you need<br/>to get them up to speed first either through /bq_copyquests<br/>above, or manually. Otherwise, your quest completion<br/>won't count for them because the requirements for that<br/>quest are not fulfilled for them.\n\nIf your singleplayer<br/>world does not have cheats enabled, go to the ESC screen,<br/>open to LAN, then enable cheats.

Can work x/s or x/t.\n\nSteam<br/>Valve: Moves more, but is only for steam. Only goes<br/>to IV. Does not work on SH steam.\n\nOverflow: Voids<br/>anything over the specified amount in the tank.\n\nFluid<br/>Detector: Will emit a redstone signal (RS) based on<br/>fluid fill rate of the tank it's on. By default, empty=15,<br/>full=0. Use inverted mode to swap. Useful on tanks<br/>and hatches.\n\nEnder Fluid Link: Cover version of ender<br/>tanks to TP fluid around. Doesn't connect to ender<br/>tanks though.\n\nDrain Module: Protects from rain on<br/>that side, and will fill the tank with water from rain<br/>if it can. Useless.\n\nFluid Filter: Filters fluid going<br/>through it. Click with a cell to set it.\n\nShutter:<br/>Blocks items/fluids when active. Use it with a machine<br/>controller and RS. Does not visually disconnect/block.<br/>You place it between the pipes, and put the MC on the<br/>same pipe.\n\n\u00a7lItem-Related Covers:\u00a7r\nConveyor: Sends<br/>items. Use an item pipe in import mode or on a GT block/machine.\n\nRobot<br/>Arm: Sends from a specific slot in the machine it's<br/>on (internal) to another specific slot in a block next<br/>to it (adjacent). Keep going through numbers until<br/>you get it right, it seems to change per machine. If<br/>the output slot is full, it won't output. There need<br/>to be a valid block with slots to send to or the settings<br/>won't save.\n\nItem Detector: Will emit RS based on item<br/>fill rate of the block it's on. By default, empty=0,<br/>full=15. Detects by filled slots, so doesn't work right<br/>with the super/quantum chests. Probably better for<br/>busses.\n\nItem Filter: This one is work-in-progress<br/>that is not yet finished. Feel free to contribute.\n\n\u00a7lEU-Related<br/>Covers:\u00a7r\nEnergy Detector: Will emit RS based on EU<br/>fill rate of the batbuff/tank it's on. By default,<br/>empty=0, full=15. Make sure to set it to include batteries.<br/>Can also detect steam for some reason.\n\nPower Pass<br/>Upgrade: Read the tooltip, then ask Bart how it works,<br/>he didn't bother telling anyone. He'll probably just<br/>tell you the code is the best documentation, just like<br/>the Tectech guys. May not actually be finished/work,<br/>either.\n\nTesla Coil/Tesla Coil Rich Edition: Use with<br/>the tesla tower to send EU wirelessly or something.<br/>\n\n\u00a7lOther Covers:\u00a7r\nPlayer Detector: Detects players.<br/>About 10 block range. [warn]Currently owner/other is<br/>inverted on non-pipes due to some bug or another.[/warn]\n\nActivity<br/>Detector: Detects either recipe progress or idleness.<br/>0%=0 RS, ~95%=14 by default. In idle mode, idleness<br/>is 15, and is 0 when running by default.\n\nMachine Controller:<br/>Turns machine on/off based on RS. Disable machine will<br/>keep it off regardless of RS state. Safe Mode only<br/>works on MBs. If a MB runs out of power, it will normally<br/>turn off, but a MC will turn it back on, continuing<br/>to void stuff. This will set it to the disable machine<br/>state instead. You will also get a notification. [warn]Safe<br/>mode is currently broken?[/warn]\n\nNeeds Maintenance:<br/>Emits RS if it meets the condition specified. Rotor=turbine?\n\nRedstone<br/>Transmitter/Receiver (In/Out): OK, these things are<br/>confusing, so listen closely. First, set a frequency,<br/>either by using the GUI, or using the original way:<br/>right clicking it with an item. Empty hand = 0, other<br/>items = their item ID. Be careful not to reset it to<br/>0 by accident. Honestly, just use the GUI. You can<br/>set it to private or not, it's the same kind of thing<br/>as EnderStorage, so you don't blare RS across the server.<br/>Channel state = RS level.\n\nRT(O) sets the channel state<br/>based on the redstone level sent from outside to the<br/>specific side. You can TP a RS from this to the RR(O).\nRT(I)<br/>sets the channel state based on redstone level that<br/>would be emitted from the machine itself. [warn]Always<br/>sends 15, so it's useless.[/warn]\nRR(O) outputs redstone<br/>level based on channel state. You can TP RS from the<br/>RT(O) to here.\nRR(I) controls whether a machine can<br/>work based on channel state, just like a machine controller<br/>cover does. If it has 0 RS, it stays off. At least<br/>1, and it turns on. You send the signal from elsewhere<br/>with the RT(O).\nRR(I) can also be used in conjunction<br/>with other covers whose states talk about conditional.\n\nIC2<br/>Heat vents: Speeds up machines a tiny amount? Also<br/>looks neat. TODO: someone please look at the code to<br/>see what it actually does.\n\nCrafting Table: Adds a<br/>crafting table to the block you can use. Mostly cosmetic.\n\nPlanks/Plates/Foils:<br/>Blocks I/O on that side. Use a screwdriver to set allowed<br/>types of stuff through. Blocks everything by default.<br/>Set the output to another side first to avoid changing<br/>its settings too. You'll probably 'use' this by accident<br/>at least once.\n\nComputer Monitor: Adds a visual look.<br/>Cosmetic-only cover.\n\nLens: Cosmetic-only cover.\n\nYou<br/>can also use AE2 facades as cosmetic covers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The<br/>breeding lines unlock bit by bit showing you what you<br/>can go for next, mostly from the top to the bottom.<br/>The large icons represent particularly powerful bees.<br/>Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options,<br/>only one is shown on the Bee Breeding Tree.\n\nBees have<br/>two sets of traits, active and inactive. The active<br/>one affects the behaviour of the bee while the inactive<br/>one is only relevant for breeding. \n\nA trait can be<br/>[warn]Dominant[/warn] or \u00a79Recessive\u00a7r. When getting<br/>newly bred princesses and drones, check both sets in<br/>case you got the desired traits. You can breed the<br/>ones with inactive traits to try and make them active<br/>in later crosses. A Field Kit or GT scanner cannot<br/>see passive traits, you need a Beealyzer for that.<br/>\n\nWhen breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon<br/>a master template bee - a bee that has little to no<br/>crossbreeding potential but has all the traits you<br/>want - short life, nocturnal, cave dwelling, rain tolerant,<br/>humidity tolerance, temperature tolerance, 4xfertility,<br/>and so on. Once you have that bee, breed a bunch of<br/>pure princesses with those traits as both active and<br/>inactive. These will be your breeding stock.\n\nWhen<br/>you are trying to get new species, what you want is<br/>a drone - this way you can use your \"breeding stock\"<br/>princess with the drone to get new species without<br/>the annoying effects or limitations. Poorly crossed<br/>princesses can be returned to normal by crossing with<br/>breeding stock drones, or just thrown into storage<br/>if they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you<br/>keep the trait and species you want, and slowly merge<br/>the good traits from your breeding stock. You don't<br/>have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee<br/>House to swap around traits. Remember that no species<br/>mutations occur in a Bee House. Ignoble bees are good<br/>to swap traits because they're mostly disposable -<br/>they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles,<br/>increasing slightly more each generation after that,<br/>though genetic stability frames can let them live longer.<br/>\n\nOnce you solidify your species, create a pool of<br/>drones. You can use those to convert pristine princesses<br/>to the new species. Pristine princesses will not die,<br/>but they can become Ignoble under certain circumstances<br/>like using tons of production frames. Rocky bees are<br/>a great source - all their princesses are always pristine,<br/>they have decent traits, and there's a bunch of them<br/>underground. If you have an ender quarry, you can collect<br/>them with that.\n\nOnce you get a new species, it will<br/>replace either all Active or Inactive traits. If the<br/>mutation happens twice at the same bee, it will replace<br/>both sets. For example, when you get a Cultivated bee,<br/>either the Active or Inactive column will have all<br/>the default Cultivated traits. Mix it a few times and<br/>you'll eventually get purebred versions. Just watch<br/>out that you don't lose a key trait, like Fast Worker<br/>for Cultivated. Most effects are useless, so you can<br/>disregard them.\n\nAll quests require purebred species.<br/>Purebred means that the inactive species-trait is the<br/>same as the active one.\n\nAll traits can be bred into<br/>any bee species, aside from the species itself. Species<br/>also determines the preferred temperature and humidity,<br/>as well as drops. Species require their preferred temperature<br/>and humidity to be in the 'jubilant' state and produce<br/>their special drops. You can also mimic this with the<br/>alveary or industrial apiary, but NOT with tolerances.\n\nAdvanced<br/>frames can provide useful boosts to mutation chances<br/>or lifespan reduction for faster breeding cycles. However,<br/>the excessive multipliers will increase genetic decay,<br/>giving a chance for a pristine princess to become ignoble.\n\nIt<br/>looks complex, because it is! But it's also a lot of<br/>dangerous and useful fun!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Especially at LV, those few blocks make<br/>a big difference! Every amp of energy traveling over<br/>a cable loses a little bit - and you'll need as much<br/>as you can get! Your best setup is to put two generators<br/>right next to each hatch, with a 2A cable. If you're<br/>poor, you could use 2 battery buffers with 2 batteries<br/>each directly attached to each hatch. Make sure to<br/>top off the buffers' generators. If you make 9 slot<br/>battery buffers, you can fill them up over time to<br/>get longer running time until you get stable power.\n\nOutput<br/>hatches and buses will automatically push into tanks<br/>and inventories placed next to them such as chests<br/>or BC tanks. They will also void if they're full, so<br/>keep an eye on them!\n\nWhen building multiple EBFs,<br/>the GregTech 1000 Electric Blast Furnace can share<br/>walls. This can save you on input and output hatches<br/>too. Not recommended for energy and maintenance hatches!<br/><br/>"

Good plants to start with<br/>are flowers, wheat, cactus and sugarcane. \n\nMake a<br/>plot of farmland with your tool and place water in<br/>the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a<br/>row of dirt or cobble. You want to be able to see the<br/>center of each column of 3x1 plots all at once, like<br/>this:\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdWdFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd<br/>\nFFFdddFFF\nNow place crop sticks in each end of the<br/>3x1 plot. Then place the seeds on the sticks and wait<br/>a bit.\n\nWhen they are almost fully grown you can put<br/>double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop<br/>sticks once more on already placed crop sticks. This<br/>center area can now grow new crops, even new species.\n\nWith<br/>some luck you might get a new unknown seed which can<br/>be scanned later.\n\nWeeds need to be removed with a<br/>trowel or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown<br/>by them.\n\nUsing 3x1 plots is easy and not much work.<br/> Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove weeds and<br/>gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one<br/>or two seeds. \n\nIf you find a really nice seed, you<br/>can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the nice seed in the middle<br/>and others next to it for crossing. But this requires<br/>more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole<br/>field.\n\nNote that the more crops next to the double<br/>crop stick the faster new plants will show up, up to<br/>4 obviously. This is also the way to get new versions<br/>of the same plant, you can't do it with just one parent<br/>like Agricraft.\n\nDon't leave new crops in these intensive<br/>fields. Pull them out and hopefully get a seedbag.<br/>Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't<br/>require babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more<br/>crossing. \n\nCrossing happens when two or more almost-mature<br/>crops are next to a double cropstick. There is a high<br/>chance of getting the same species as the parents.<br/>The rest of the time will be a mutation. For more details,<br/>check out the IC2 cropnalyzer quest.<br/><br/><br/>"

Fires next<br/>to a machine have a random chance of an explosion.<br/>Also, sending a higher voltage than a machine's tier<br/>causes an explosion. Or several, if you pack things<br/>together, like many people. Sending more amps than<br/>a machine can use doesn't harm anything though.\n\nSending<br/>too high a voltage or too many amps down a cable will<br/>cause the cable to burn up and start fires, which may<br/>then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number<br/>of amps provided by generators and buffers to a cable<br/>does not exceed the amps it is capable of carrying.\n\nA<br/>generator that supplies 1A can possibly feed multiple<br/>machines, if their recipes require less than the full<br/>voltage.  For example, macerators processing ore only<br/>need 2 EU/t, so you could run several from a single<br/>1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too long.<br/>Why does that matter? Because there's loss for every<br/>amp for every block, listed on the wire/cable. Note<br/>that cables are better than wires. But be careful!<br/>Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect,<br/>like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.\n\nMost<br/>machines only use 1A, however there are exceptions,<br/>such as the arc furnace, thermal centrifuge, world<br/>accelerators, and the UUM machines. Note that machines<br/>can accept more amps than they use (usually 2) in order<br/>to top up their energy supply, especially if they didn't<br/>recieve most of the amp because of loss (mostly a problem<br/>in LV). The formula is (EU/t of Recipe * 2) / Voltage<br/>Tier + 1. Keep this in mind when deciding on cables.\n\nSome<br/>machines are specifically there to help you deal with<br/>multiple amps, such as battery buffers, transformers,<br/>and diodes. Check out the quest tab Storing and Transforming<br/>EU for more on those.\n\nIf you want to send more amps,<br/>use a larger cable or a superconductor (MV+, but ULV<br/>and LV have their own lossless cables). You can use<br/>laser hatches much later to send even more. There even<br/>are wireless options, but not right now.\n\nA single<br/>block machine starved of EU will restart progress but<br/>not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will<br/>lose the items.\n\nNote that any block that emits EU<br/>has loss when doing so: 2 ^ (tier-1) per amp. So 1<br/>EU at LV, 2 EU at MV, and so on. Using large numbers<br/>of battery buffers in a row is thus very wasteful of<br/>your power. You have to be careful with losses when<br/>making your first EBF later in LV, maybe rather power<br/>them directly? Of course, if you want to keep your<br/>amps topped up over longer distances, you'll need to<br/>place BBs occasionally to 'top up' the amps, though<br/>this is less the case the further ingame you get, as<br/>the loss becomes less of something to worry about.\n\nIf<br/>this info isn't enough for you, head on over to [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Electricity[/url]<br/>to read more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"
