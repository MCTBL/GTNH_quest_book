Additionally, the bigger your Steam/EU<br/>buffer is, the less time your generators will spend heating up, which makes<br/>them more efficient. \n\nUse a Machine Controller Cover on the controller<br/>for that. You can put it on top, bottom, or sides next to a casing - casings<br/>will transmit the redstone signal. You can use a Soldering Iron and Fine<br/>Soldering Alloy Wire to set the Redstone Output of a controller block to<br/>strong. When set to Strong it can go through a casing, but not hatches,<br/>buses, or other blocks. Use it with an activity detector if you want to<br/>receive a signal from the controller rather than turning it on/off with<br/>one.\n\nWith a Machine Controller Cover, you can use redstone to turn the<br/>machine on and off. This is handy if you don't want to use a Soft Hammer<br/>to disable a machine yourself constantly.\n \nThe best way to do that is<br/>with an RS latch. One input will turn the machine on, and one input will<br/>turn the machine off. Use a comparator attached to a valve to measure the<br/>steam level in your multiblock Iron or Steel Tank. Invert the signal to<br/>turn on your boiler when the steam level is low. When the steam level signal<br/>is high, turn your boiler off. Use a trail of redstone to lower the signal<br/>strength. Because of boiler/turbine warmup, try to set the ON strength<br/>to 30 percent of capacity and OFF strength to about 90 percent.\n\nRed alloy<br/>wire will hold a redstone signal for a longer distance than normal redstone,<br/>while redstone conduits will go indefinitely. You can also use amplified<br/>redcrystal to improve the strength of the signal for a long distance, repeating<br/>as necessary. \n\nYou can use a Energy Detector Cover in Normal Electrical<br/>Storage (including batteries) mode to monitor the power in a battery buffer<br/>and use it to enable/disable generators in a similar way. Change mode using<br/>a screwdriver. If you use a dense redcrystal, it will only allow signal<br/>through at a certain level, perfect for automating this kind of thing.\n\nYou<br/>can use MCCs on more than just generators though, you can use it on any<br/>multiblock and most singleblocks. This is useful to prevent voiding of<br/>materials. Unlike GT++ multies that will halt if full, a non-GT++ multi<br/>will void the items or liquids and keep on working, potentially voiding<br/>huge amounts of materials. You'll want to use them in combination with<br/>Fluid or Item Detection Covers on the output hatch or bus.\n\nFor a video<br/>version, check out this video: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPfnifJEO64[/url]<br/><br/>"

Shift-Right-Click<br/>will open a GUI for many of them. For covers that you can adjust the amount<br/>of, clicking the left side with a screwdriver goes down, and right goes<br/>up. All covers block rain on the side they're attached to. Generally you<br/>can adjust covers with a screwdriver, whether they have a GUI or not. You<br/>can remove them with a crowbar if you forgot.\n\nFluid-Related Covers:\nPump:<br/>Transfers fluids at the speed specified on the tooltip.\n\nFluid Regulator:<br/>Regulates the rate that fluid can go through it, as well as pumping it.<br/>Can work x/s or x/t.\n\nSteam Valve: Moves more, but is only for steam. Only<br/>goes to IV. Does not work on SH steam.\n\nOverflow: Voids anything over the<br/>specified amount in the tank.\n\nFluid Detector: Will emit a redstone signal<br/>(RS) based on fluid fill rate of the tank it's on. By default, empty=15,<br/>full=0. Use inverted mode to swap. Useful on tanks and hatches.\n\nEnder<br/>Fluid Link: Cover version of ender tanks to TP fluid around. Doesn't connect<br/>to ender tanks though.\n\nDrain Module: Protects from rain on that side,<br/>and will fill the tank with water from rain if it can. Useless.\n\nFluid<br/>Filter: Filters fluid going through it. Click with a cell to set it.\n\nShutter:<br/>Blocks items/fluids when active. Use it with a machine controller and RS.<br/>Does not visually disconnect/block. You place it between the pipes, and<br/>put the MC on the same pipe.\n\nItem-Related Covers:\nConveyor: Sends items.<br/>Use an item pipe in import mode or on a GT block/machine.\n\nRobot Arm: Sends<br/>from a specific slot in the machine it's on (internal) to another specific<br/>slot in a block next to it (adjacent). Keep going through numbers until<br/>you get it right, it seems to change per machine. If the output slot is<br/>full, it won't output. There need to be a valid block with slots to send<br/>to or the settings won't save.\n\nItem Detector: Will emit RS based on item<br/>fill rate of the block it's on. By default, empty=0, full=15. Detects by<br/>filled slots, so doesn't work right with the super/quantum chests. Probably<br/>better for busses.\n\nItem Filter: This one is work-in-progress that is not<br/>yet finished. Feel free to contribute.\n\nEU-Related Covers:\nEnergy Detector:<br/>Will emit RS based on EU fill rate of the batbuff/tank it's on. By default,<br/>empty=0, full=15. Make sure to set it to include batteries. Can also detect<br/>steam for some reason.\n\nPower Pass Upgrade: Read the tooltip, then ask<br/>Bart how it works, he didn't bother telling anyone. He'll probably just<br/>tell you the code is the best documentation, just like the Tectech guys.<br/>May not actually be finished/work, either.\n\nTesla Coil/Tesla Coil Rich<br/>Edition: Use with the tesla tower to send EU wirelessly or something. \n\nOther<br/>Covers:\nPlayer Detector: Detects players. About 10 block range. [warn]Currently<br/>owner/other is inverted on non-pipes due to some bug or another.[/warn]\n\nActivity<br/>Detector: Detects either recipe progress or idleness. 0%=0 RS, ~95%=14<br/>by default. In idle mode, idleness is 15, and is 0 when running by default.\n\nMachine<br/>Controller: Turns machine on/off based on RS. Disable machine will keep<br/>it off regardless of RS state. Safe Mode only works on MBs. If a MB runs<br/>out of power, it will normally turn off, but a MC will turn it back on,<br/>continuing to void stuff. This will set it to the disable machine state<br/>instead. You will also get a notification. [warn]Safe mode is currently<br/>broken?[/warn]\n\nNeeds Maintenance: Emits RS if it meets the condition specified.<br/>Rotor=turbine?\n\nRedstone Transmitter/Receiver (In/Out): OK, these things<br/>are confusing, so listen closely. First, set a frequency, either by using<br/>the GUI, or using the original way: right clicking it with an item. Empty<br/>hand = 0, other items = their item ID. Be careful not to reset it to 0<br/>by accident. Honestly, just use the GUI. You can set it to private or not,<br/>it's the same kind of thing as EnderStorage, so you don't blare RS across<br/>the server. Channel state = RS level.\n\nRT(O) sets the channel state based<br/>on the redstone level sent from outside to the specific side. You can TP<br/>a RS from this to the RR(O).\nRT(I) sets the channel state based on redstone<br/>level that would be emitted from the machine itself. [warn]Always sends<br/>15, so it's useless.[/warn]\nRR(O) outputs redstone level based on channel<br/>state. You can TP RS from the RT(O) to here.\nRR(I) controls whether a machine<br/>can work based on channel state, just like a machine controller cover does.<br/>If it has 0 RS, it stays off. At least 1, and it turns on. You send the<br/>signal from elsewhere with the RT(O).\nRR(I) can also be used in conjunction<br/>with other covers whose states talk about conditional.\n\nIC2 Heat vents:<br/>Speeds up machines a tiny amount? Also looks neat. TODO: someone please<br/>look at the code to see what it actually does.\n\nCrafting Table: Adds a<br/>crafting table to the block you can use. Mostly cosmetic.\n\nPlanks/Plates/Foils:<br/>Blocks I/O on that side. Use a screwdriver to set allowed types of stuff<br/>through. Blocks everything by default. Set the output to another side first<br/>to avoid changing its settings too. You'll probably 'use' this by accident<br/>at least once.\n\nComputer Monitor: Adds a visual look. Cosmetic-only cover.\n\nLens:<br/>Cosmetic-only cover.\n\nYou can also use AE2 facades as cosmetic covers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

There's even more that aren't included<br/>and you'll need NEI to find!\n\nHa ha, just kidding - don't panic! The breeding<br/>lines unlock bit by bit showing you what you can go for next, mostly from<br/>the top to the bottom. The large icons represent particularly powerful<br/>bees. Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options, only one is<br/>shown on the Bee Breeding Tree.\n\nBees have two sets of traits, active and<br/>inactive. The active one affects the behaviour of the bee while the inactive<br/>one is only relevant for breeding. \n\nA trait can be [warn]Dominant[/warn]<br/>or Recessive. When getting newly bred princesses and drones, check both<br/>sets in case you got the desired traits. You can breed the ones with inactive<br/>traits to try and make them active in later crosses. A Field Kit or GT<br/>scanner cannot see passive traits, you need a Beealyzer for that. \n\nWhen<br/>breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon a master template bee - a<br/>bee that has little to no crossbreeding potential but has all the traits<br/>you want - short life, nocturnal, cave dwelling, rain tolerant, humidity<br/>tolerance, temperature tolerance, 4xfertility, and so on. Once you have<br/>that bee, breed a bunch of pure princesses with those traits as both active<br/>and inactive. These will be your breeding stock.\n\nWhen you are trying to<br/>get new species, what you want is a drone - this way you can use your \"breeding<br/>stock\" princess with the drone to get new species without the annoying<br/>effects or limitations. Poorly crossed princesses can be returned to normal<br/>by crossing with breeding stock drones, or just thrown into storage if<br/>they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you keep the trait and species<br/>you want, and slowly merge the good traits from your breeding stock. You<br/>don't have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee House to swap<br/>around traits. Remember that no species mutations occur in a Bee House.<br/>Ignoble bees are good to swap traits because they're mostly disposable<br/>- they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles, increasing slightly<br/>more each generation after that, though genetic stability frames can let<br/>them live longer. \n\nOnce you solidify your species, create a pool of drones.<br/>You can use those to convert pristine princesses to the new species. Pristine<br/>princesses will not die, but they can become Ignoble under certain circumstances<br/>like using tons of production frames. Rocky bees are a great source - all<br/>their princesses are always pristine, they have decent traits, and there's<br/>a bunch of them underground. If you have an ender quarry, you can collect<br/>them with that.\n\nOnce you get a new species, it will replace either all<br/>Active or Inactive traits. If the mutation happens twice at the same bee,<br/>it will replace both sets. For example, when you get a Cultivated bee,<br/>either the Active or Inactive column will have all the default Cultivated<br/>traits. Mix it a few times and you'll eventually get purebred versions.<br/>Just watch out that you don't lose a key trait, like Fast Worker for Cultivated.<br/>Most effects are useless, so you can disregard them.\n\nAll quests require<br/>purebred species. Purebred means that the inactive species-trait is the<br/>same as the active one.\n\nAll traits can be bred into any bee species, aside<br/>from the species itself. Species also determines the preferred temperature<br/>and humidity, as well as drops. Species require their preferred temperature<br/>and humidity to be in the 'jubilant' state and produce their special drops.<br/>You can also mimic this with the alveary or industrial apiary, but NOT<br/>with tolerances.\n\nAdvanced frames can provide useful boosts to mutation<br/>chances or lifespan reduction for faster breeding cycles. However, the<br/>excessive multipliers will increase genetic decay, giving a chance for<br/>a pristine princess to become ignoble.\n\nIt looks complex, because it is!<br/>But it's also a lot of dangerous and useful fun!<br/><br/>"

Every amp of<br/>energy traveling over a cable loses a little bit - and you'll need as much<br/>as you can get! Your best setup is to put two generators right next to<br/>each hatch, with a 2A cable. If you're poor, you could use 2 battery buffers<br/>with 2 batteries each directly attached to each hatch. Make sure to top<br/>off the buffers' generators. If you make 9 slot battery buffers, you can<br/>fill them up over time to get longer running time until you get stable<br/>power.\n\nOutput hatches and buses will automatically push into tanks and<br/>inventories placed next to them such as chests or BC tanks.

Get some Crops - the sticks, that is - and some seeds from farming<br/>with a hoe or mattock. You can also place some plants and berries directly<br/>on crop sticks. Good plants to start with are flowers, wheat, cactus and<br/>sugarcane. \n\nMake a plot of farmland with your tool and place water in<br/>the middle. For now, make 3x1 plots, separated by a row of dirt or cobble.<br/>You want to be able to see the center of each column of 3x1 plots all at<br/>once, like this:\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdWdFFF\ndddFFFddd\nFFFdddFFF\ndddFFFddd<br/>\nFFFdddFFF\nNow place crop sticks in each end of the 3x1 plot. Then place<br/>the seeds on the sticks and wait a bit.\n\nWhen they are almost fully grown<br/>you can put double crop sticks in the center spots by using crop sticks<br/>once more on already placed crop sticks. This center area can now grow<br/>new crops, even new species.\n\nWith some luck you might get a new unknown<br/>seed which can be scanned later.\n\nWeeds need to be removed with a trowel<br/>or spade otherwise your field will become overgrown by them.\n\nUsing 3x1<br/>plots is easy and not much work.  Check them every 5-10 minutes to remove<br/>weeds and gather new seeds. If you forget, you only lose one or two seeds.<br/>\n\nIf you find a really nice seed, you can do 3x3 or 5x5 plots with the<br/>nice seed in the middle and others next to it for crossing. But this requires<br/>more babysitting since weeds could destroy the whole field.\n\nNote that<br/>the more crops next to the double crop stick the faster new plants will<br/>show up, up to 4 obviously. This is also the way to get new versions of<br/>the same plant, you can't do it with just one parent like Agricraft.\n\nDon't<br/>leave new crops in these intensive fields. Pull them out and hopefully<br/>get a seedbag. Put low stat seeds in production fields that don't require<br/>babysitting. Keep the high stat seeds for more crossing. \n\nCrossing happens<br/>when two or more almost-mature crops are next to a double cropstick. There<br/>is a high chance of getting the same species as the parents. The rest of<br/>the time will be a mutation. For more details, check out the IC2 cropnalyzer<br/>quest."

Also, sending<br/>a higher voltage than a machine's tier causes an explosion. Or several,<br/>if you pack things together, like many people. Sending more amps than a<br/>machine can use doesn't harm anything though.\n\nSending too high a voltage<br/>or too many amps down a cable will cause the cable to burn up and start<br/>fires, which may then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number of<br/>amps provided by generators and buffers to a cable does not exceed the<br/>amps it is capable of carrying.\n\nA generator that supplies 1A can possibly<br/>feed multiple machines, if their recipes require less than the full voltage.<br/> For example, macerators processing ore only need 2 EU/t, so you could<br/>run several from a single 1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too<br/>long. Why does that matter? Because there's loss for every amp for every<br/>block, listed on the wire/cable. Note that cables are better than wires.<br/>But be careful! Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect,<br/>like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.\n\nMost machines only use 1A,<br/>however there are exceptions, such as the arc furnace, thermal centrifuge,<br/>world accelerators, and the UUM machines. Note that machines can accept<br/>more amps than they use (usually 2) in order to top up their energy supply,<br/>especially if they didn't recieve most of the amp because of loss (mostly<br/>a problem in LV). The formula is (EU/t of Recipe * 2) / Voltage Tier +<br/>1. Keep this in mind when deciding on cables.\n\nSome machines are specifically<br/>there to help you deal with multiple amps, such as battery buffers, transformers,<br/>and diodes. Check out the quest tab Storing and Transforming EU for more<br/>on those.\n\nIf you want to send more amps, use a larger cable or a superconductor<br/>(MV+, but ULV and LV have their own lossless cables). You can use laser<br/>hatches much later to send even more. There even are wireless options,<br/>but not right now.\n\nA single block machine starved of EU will restart progress<br/>but not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will lose the items.\n\nNote<br/>that any block that emits EU has loss when doing so: 2 ^ (tier-1) per amp.<br/>So 1 EU at LV, 2 EU at MV, and so on. Using large numbers of battery buffers<br/>in a row is thus very wasteful of your power. You have to be careful with<br/>losses when making your first EBF later in LV, maybe rather power them<br/>directly? Of course, if you want to keep your amps topped up over longer<br/>distances, you'll need to place BBs occasionally to 'top up' the amps,<br/>though this is less the case the further ingame you get, as the loss becomes<br/>less of something to worry about.\n\nIf this info isn't enough for you, head<br/>on over to [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Electricity[/url] to<br/>read more.<br/>"
