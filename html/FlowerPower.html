This ethereal<br/>blue-ish substance is produced by generating flowers,<br/>when their requirements are met. Mana is not easily<br/>quantified, so you will have to do a lot of estimating<br/>if you want to use it efficiently.\n\nOnce you have chosen<br/>which flower you want to use to generate mana, you<br/>must plant it near a mana spreader. When the flower's<br/>conditions are fulfilled, it will begin to produce<br/>mana, and store it in the internal buffer of the nearest<br/>mana spreader. The mana spreader itself will automatically<br/>emit any mana it contains, provided it is aimed at<br/>a valid destination (such as a mana pool). You'll need<br/>a lot of these devices, so craft a pair for now.\n\nMana<br/>spreaders will aim towards you when you place them<br/>down. To change their direction, use a wand of the<br/>forest: while holding the wand, shift+right click on<br/>the mana spreader, and then shift+right click on the<br/>block you want it to aim at. This method of binding<br/>also works for other things, such as binding a flower<br/>to a specific mana spreader.<br/>"
