Mana is not easily quantified,<br/>so you will have to do a lot of estimating if you want to use it efficiently.\n\nOnce<br/>you have chosen which flower you want to use to generate mana, you must<br/>plant it near a mana spreader. When the flower's conditions are fulfilled,<br/>it will begin to produce mana, and store it in the internal buffer of the<br/>nearest mana spreader. The mana spreader itself will automatically emit<br/>any mana it contains, provided it is aimed at a valid destination (such<br/>as a mana pool). You'll need a lot of these devices, so craft a pair for<br/>now.\n\nMana spreaders will aim towards you when you place them down. To<br/>change their direction, use a wand of the forest: while holding the wand,<br/>shift+right click on the mana spreader, and then shift+right click on the<br/>block you want it to aim at. This method of binding also works for other<br/>things, such as binding a flower to a specific mana spreader."
