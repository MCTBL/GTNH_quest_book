This method will create pollution from<br/>the Pyrolyze Oven, but will provide more Benzene per log.\n\nExcess wood<br/>tar can also be turned into Toluene, a key ingredient for explosives that<br/>you'll need later on to make rockets.\n\nIf you use the Charcoal Byproducts<br/>recipe, you can get a plethora of useful byproducts as well, but you'll<br/>need 4 DTs.\n\n[note]Later on you will get an even better option in the form<br/>the Industrial Coke Oven.[/note]"
