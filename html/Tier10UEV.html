For a<br/>true breacher of technology, the constraints of physics<br/>and chemistry are not essential. To skip past their<br/>technicalities, the Quantum Force Transformer comes<br/>into play.\n\nThis multi is meant to replicate the most<br/>popular and important processing lines in the pack\u2019s<br/>progression, mostly those related to chemistry. Because<br/>of recursion in recipes, where earlier tier materials<br/>are required to craft higher tier equivalents, there<br/>are a lot of early processing lines that stay up through<br/>progression. Even worse, they often need more and more<br/>machines to keep up with increasing speed demands.<br/>To save on lag, this multi will do those processing<br/>lines in one step and without most of the extra chemicals<br/>that are added to purify the inputs into the outputs.\n\nThe<br/>Quantum Force Transformer (QFT) is unlocked in UEV,<br/>after Optical Mainframes have been crafted, and with<br/>the addition of a single Eternal Singularity and other<br/>materials. It\u2019s a tall, 15x15 multiblock with many<br/>different casings, including two that are upgradable<br/>and decide the two tiers of the multi. Although it\u2019s<br/>available in UEV, the upgraded casings require more<br/>and more expensive materials, while also unlocking<br/>skips for more advanced processing lines. For example,<br/>a platline skip can be done in the earlier QFT tier,<br/>whereas a Kevlar skip can only be done in the last<br/>tier.\n\nEach recipe that the QFT has represents a single<br/>processing line or a big part of a line. The inputs<br/>for the early plastic skip, for example, are the basic<br/>components of the plastics on a molecular level (Carbon,<br/>Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc.), and not the multi-step chemicals<br/>that were used half a dozen tiers earlier. All recipes<br/>have 3 or more outputs, and every output has a chance<br/>to appear: the chance for each is 100% divided by the<br/>number of outputs. To increase it, there are additional<br/>mechanics that can be used.\n\nSimply put, the QFT uses<br/>huge amounts of energy and quantum field stabilization<br/>to disassemble simple molecules and assemble them into<br/>more complex ones, without needing additives or constrained<br/>processes. The only addition to the base inputs that<br/>the multi requires is a specific catalyst, which the<br/>smart circuits use to guide the materials into what<br/>they ultimately transform into, but they are never<br/>consumed or lost in any way. \n\nThis direct process<br/>simplifies long processing chains to one step, but<br/>it has two consequences: it makes the process expensive,<br/>given the extreme conditions needed to undergo the<br/>transformation (in a similar way to fusion), but it<br/>also generates many different outputs at once, none<br/>of which are guaranteed, and it\u2019s impossible to choose<br/>between them without adding something else into the<br/>setup to alter the conditions inside the QFT in some<br/>way. Throwing more energy into the multi won\u2019t do anything,<br/>and better materials don\u2019t seem to work, so what is<br/>the next step? That is what the next two quests will<br/>answer.\n<br/><br/><br/>"
