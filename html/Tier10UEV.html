However,<br/>the truly wise are the ones who know what is unimportant and can be skipped.<br/>For a true breacher of technology, the constraints of physics and chemistry<br/>are not essential. To skip past their technicalities, the Quantum Force<br/>Transformer comes into play.\n\nThis multi is meant to replicate the most<br/>popular and important processing lines in the pack\u2019s progression, mostly<br/>those related to chemistry. Because of recursion in recipes, where earlier<br/>tier materials are required to craft higher tier equivalents, there are<br/>a lot of early processing lines that stay up through progression. Even<br/>worse, they often need more and more machines to keep up with increasing<br/>speed demands. To save on lag, this multi will do those processing lines<br/>in one step and without most of the extra chemicals that are added to purify<br/>the inputs into the outputs.\n\nThe Quantum Force Transformer (QFT) is unlocked<br/>in UEV, after Optical Mainframes have been crafted, and with the addition<br/>of a single Eternal Singularity and other materials. It\u2019s a tall, 15x15<br/>multiblock with many different casings, including two that are upgradable<br/>and decide the two tiers of the multi. Although it\u2019s available in UEV,<br/>the upgraded casings require more and more expensive materials, while also<br/>unlocking skips for more advanced processing lines. For example, a platline<br/>skip can be done in the earlier QFT tier, whereas a Kevlar skip can only<br/>be done in the last tier.\n\nEach recipe that the QFT has represents a single<br/>processing line or a big part of a line. The inputs for the early plastic<br/>skip, for example, are the basic components of the plastics on a molecular<br/>level (Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc.), and not the multi-step chemicals<br/>that were used half a dozen tiers earlier. All recipes have 3 or more outputs,<br/>and every output has a chance to appear: the chance for each is 100% divided<br/>by the number of outputs. To increase it, there are additional mechanics<br/>that can be used.\n\nSimply put, the QFT uses huge amounts of energy and<br/>quantum field stabilization to disassemble simple molecules and assemble<br/>them into more complex ones, without needing additives or constrained processes.<br/>The only addition to the base inputs that the multi requires is a specific<br/>catalyst, which the smart circuits use to guide the materials into what<br/>they ultimately transform into, but they are never consumed or lost in<br/>any way. \n\nThis direct process simplifies long processing chains to one<br/>step, but it has two consequences: it makes the process expensive, given<br/>the extreme conditions needed to undergo the transformation (in a similar<br/>way to fusion), but it also generates many different outputs at once, none<br/>of which are guaranteed, and it\u2019s impossible to choose between them without<br/>adding something else into the setup to alter the conditions inside the<br/>QFT in some way. Throwing more energy into the multi won\u2019t do anything,<br/>and better materials don\u2019t seem to work, so what is the next step? That<br/>is what the next two quests will answer.\n<br/>"
