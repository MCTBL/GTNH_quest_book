It also gives a small chance<br/>of undead dropping Spectral Dust.\n\nWhen only using<br/>vanilla Minecraft with Witchery (and no other mods),<br/>an Arthana dagger is the only way to get a skull to<br/>drop when a skeleton is killed, the drop chance is<br/>about 5% (the skull is a key upgrade for an altar).<br/>The dagger even gives a very small probability for<br/>other head drops (from mobs and players). All drop<br/>chances are increased with the Looting enchantment.\n\nAn<br/>Arthana does not change the drop chance for Wither<br/>Skeleton Skulls, that will require the Looting enchantment<br/>as usual.\n\nSome Circle Magic rites use an Arthana as<br/>a foci, the Arthana is not consumed in the process.<br/>"

You can<br/>have 6, with one extra appearing for Cauldron work.<br/>Consider keeping some extras around in a dungeon just<br/>in case.\n\nAfter you recruit your coven, you just need<br/>a few things for the ritual itself: Spider Eye, Toe<br/>of Frog, Wool of Bat, Tongue of Dog, Owlet's Wing,<br/>Attuned Stone, and Attuned Stone (Charged).\n\nTo specify<br/>the biome, look in the Book of Biomes, and find 1)<br/>the type (Forest, Plains, etc), and 2) the number.<br/>Type determines the foci used, and number determines<br/>the amount of Glowstone Dust used to get that specific<br/>biome.
