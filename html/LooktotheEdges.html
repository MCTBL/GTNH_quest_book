The dagger<br/>even gives a very small probability for other head drops (from mobs and<br/>players). All drop chances are increased with the Looting enchantment.\n\nAn<br/>Arthana does not change the drop chance for Wither Skeleton Skulls, that<br/>will require the Looting enchantment as usual.\n\nSome Circle Magic rites<br/>use an Arthana as a foci, the Arthana is not consumed in the process."

They will sometimes appear near your spawn point if<br/>you walk by it, so don't position it over lava or something, since they<br/>CAN die and reduce the number of your coven. You can have 6, with one extra<br/>appearing for Cauldron work. Consider keeping some extras around in a dungeon<br/>just in case.\n\nAfter you recruit your coven, you just need a few things<br/>for the ritual itself: Spider Eye, Toe of Frog, Wool of Bat, Tongue of<br/>Dog, Owlet's Wing, Attuned Stone, and Attuned Stone (Charged).\n\nTo specify<br/>the biome, look in the Book of Biomes, and find 1) the type (Forest, Plains,<br/>etc), and 2) the number. Type determines the foci used, and number determines<br/>the amount of Glowstone Dust used to get that specific biome. Make sure<br/>to pack up a ritual circle into a circle talisman so you don't have to<br/>redraw it, and bring some cobblestone to make a flat area (15x15, any height).<br/>Try not to do it at night unless you like dealing with infernals.\n\nTo actually<br/>do the ritual, have the ritual circle on the ground, the items (including<br/>the foci and Glowstone) in the circle, and right-click the center with<br/>the Seer's Stone.\n\nThe area affected is determined by the number of witches<br/>in your coven. It's 16 * (size of coven - 3) radius in a circular area,<br/>so 16/32/48 if it doesn't fail.\n\nUnfortunately, sometimes after logging<br/>out and back in again you may find that it didn't work correctly in specific<br/>chunks, this is (possibly) due to lack of chunk updates and it not saving<br/>the changed biome ID correctly. Just redoing the ritual doesn't really<br/>help, you'll just get patches in the same places, however placing water<br/>after the ritual and before logging out may help with this. Or use chickens.<br/>Lots of chickens.\n\nAlso, if you already have crops in the area, they'll<br/>disappear until a block update or relog.\n\n[note]PS: To pack your circle<br/>back up, you need to bring your altar with you.[/note]<br/>"
