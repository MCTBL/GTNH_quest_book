The exact charging speed is `(number of<br/>rods adjacent) * (floor(hull temperature/3000) + 1)`<br/>per second. A dual rod will count as 2 rods and quad<br/>fuel rod will count as 4 rods for this purpose. The<br/>Glowstone rod will neither emit heat, nor cause other<br/>component to emit more heat. You can treat this rod<br/>as a reactor plating in the IC2 Reactor Planner.\n\nAs<br/>you can see, the speed is directly proportional to<br/>hull temperature and rods adjacent. At the very extreme<br/>you can fully charge up a Glowstone rod in less than<br/>half a minute and output one Sunnarium every 10 second<br/>(on average, since cells aren't charged at same speed<br/>due to different position), but that require very considerable<br/>resource to setup. It also involves a vacuum freezer<br/>to cooldown the coolant cells and running the reactor<br/>at 66000+ hull temperature. Balance your need and your<br/>resource situation wisely.
