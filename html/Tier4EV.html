Well there are couple of ways, but at EV you'll need to radiate<br/>Glowstone and convert to Sunnarium.\n\nThe Glowstone rod will slowly charge<br/>up if you put it next to any fuel rod in your IC2 reactor. The exact charging<br/>speed is `(number of rods adjacent) * (floor(hull temperature/3000) + 1)`<br/>per second. A dual rod will count as 2 rods and quad fuel rod will count<br/>as 4 rods for this purpose. The Glowstone rod will neither emit heat, nor<br/>cause other component to emit more heat. You can treat this rod as a reactor<br/>plating in the IC2 Reactor Planner.\n\nAs you can see, the speed is directly<br/>proportional to hull temperature and rods adjacent. At the very extreme<br/>you can fully charge up a Glowstone rod in less than half a minute and<br/>output one Sunnarium every 10 second (on average, since cells aren't charged<br/>at same speed due to different position), but that require very considerable<br/>resource to setup. It also involves a vacuum freezer to cooldown the coolant<br/>cells and running the reactor at 66000+ hull temperature. Balance your<br/>need and your resource situation wisely. In any case, if you just wish<br/>to charge it up FAST then here is a possible string for the IC2 Reactor<br/>Planner:\n\nerp=bpO50cpsdtJElVqn4hObFJc0tiOE0JpEHYpqTxJHvyezjSKRjUuwgouXzNOlU4a3hFBRygM=\n\nReplace<br/>Containment Reactor Plating with actual Glowstone rods and you should be<br/>good to go.
