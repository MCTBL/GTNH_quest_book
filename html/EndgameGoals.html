Johny burned out towards the end, and GDCloud was surpassed<br/>by a silent contender, StarStack, being the first to conquer this challenge<br/>on the 26th of June, 2023.\n\nBeyond just the first, this era marked the<br/>beginning of the Group Run Era, with large runs such as Ballers Run (setting<br/>this era into motion), Bee Run (affecting wide change on the NH project<br/>and its management as a whole), and Cell Run 2 (the fastest ever Stargate<br/>run, in only 73 days, popularizing many automation techniques like Level<br/>Maintained lines).\n\nAdditionally, this version saw the first player achieve<br/>GTNH Gods, reaching Stargate in a 3rd run, earned by GDCloud as a part<br/>of Cell Run 2 on the 23rd of June, 2024. Later this Stargate would see<br/>three others reach this goal, Ramspace on the 29th of September, 2024,<br/>and StaffiX and serenibyss in a group run on the 17th of November, 2024.\n\nP.S.:<br/>Here's the list as usual:\n-Many new processing multiblocks like HILE, Fluid<br/>Shaper, Industrial Autoclave, etc.\n-Forge of the Gods, Black Hole Compressor,<br/>Antimatter power generation, Precise Assembler T4\n-DTPF Convergence, Component<br/>Assembly Line tiered bonuses, Mega Vac Subspace Cooling, MK5 fusion skips<br/>for Metastable Oganesson\n-Wireless Data Hatches, Wireless Optical Hatches,<br/>Uncertainty Resolution\n-Artificial Universe Cells, smart blocking mode[/note]<br/><br/>"
