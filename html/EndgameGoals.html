Later this Stargate would see three others<br/>reach this goal, \u00a7aRamspace\u00a7r on the \u00a7a29th of September,<br/>2024\u00a7r, and \u00a7aStaffiX\u00a7r and \u00a7aserenibyss\u00a7r in a group<br/>run on the \u00a7a17th of November, 2024\u00a7r.\n\nP.S.: Here's<br/>the list as usual:\n-Many new processing multiblocks<br/>like HILE, Fluid Shaper, Industrial Autoclave, etc.\n-Forge<br/>of the Gods, Black Hole Compressor, Antimatter power<br/>generation, Precise Assembler T4\n-DTPF Convergence,<br/>Component Assembly Line tiered bonuses, Mega Vac Subspace<br/>Cooling, MK5 fusion skips for Metastable Oganesson\n-Wireless<br/>Data Hatches, Wireless Optical Hatches, Uncertainty<br/>Resolution\n-Artificial Universe Cells, smart blocking<br/>mode[/note]<br/><br/><br/>"
