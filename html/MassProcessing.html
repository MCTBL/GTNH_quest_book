If you only want one (for<br/>the microprocessors for example), just divide by 4.\n\nAssuming<br/>you got the necessary imprints on the LuV tab, you<br/>can now craft the CALs for the crystalprocessor series.<br/>We're starting with 4 since you'll need one per circuit,<br/>the imprint is not removable. And yes this means you<br/>need one for every circuit type you want to make with<br/>the CAL.\n\nAs an Assembly Line, it generally works like<br/>the normal one, with different items in each bus, but<br/>since it's only one item per CAL, it's far easier to<br/>use, and the recipe is cheaper too.\n\nThe CAL uses 'wraps'<br/>to make 16 of a circuit at a time (aside from ULV and<br/>LV circuits), saving you time, EU, and Soldering Alloy<br/>(or Indalloy). You make the wraps in an Assembler with<br/>16 of the item and Polyethylene.\n\n[note]BTW you can<br/>change out the Hatches and Busses for better ones,<br/>but you still need to keep ingredient order. Also CAL<br/>grants perfect overclock.[/note]<br/>"
