The less obvious option is a Steam Turbine<br/>multi, which outputs Distilled Water that is supposedly piped back to where<br/>the steam is made. However, there are several steam producers that use<br/>regular water, so you can try that? The DT is the simplest and most direct<br/>option, though. 3-high is the minimum, so you have to build it like that.<br/>It doesn't need a lot of power, it will fill up a tank of any size over<br/>time since the water input is completely free.\n\nTo prevent it from running<br/>continuously, though, here's a neat trick, in case you haven't done it<br/>already: take the output hatch on the second layer, where the Distilled<br/>Water comes from, and put it directly above the DT controller. Then, put<br/>a Fluid Detector Cover on the bottom side of the hatch and a Machine Controller<br/>Cover on the top side of the controller, so that the covers are facing<br/>each other. Set the controller cover to \"Disable with Redstone\", and the<br/>DT will stop after the fluid tank you've chosen is full. When it gets full,<br/>the output hatch will get stuck with some water, and it will send a redstone<br/>signal that stops the DT."
