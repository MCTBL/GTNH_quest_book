To crack the fuels, they must<br/>not be sulfuric, and you will need either Hydrogen (hydro-cracking) or<br/>Steam (steam-cracking) to successfully crack. Your Hydrogen source for<br/>desulfurizing is hopefully good enough to sustain hydro-cracking, and the<br/>Steam you were previously using for power can now be useful to get more<br/>out of the Oil you're pumping.\n\nHeavy Fuel, Light Fuel, Refinery Gas and<br/>Naphtha can each be cracked both ways, and with three different intensities:<br/>lightly, moderately or severely cracked. This means that each portion has<br/>6 different cracking options, and the products of distilling them can be<br/>cracked once more! There are a lot of options here, but a few of them stand<br/>out for their usefulness.\n\nThe first one you should try is Refinery Gas.<br/>In order to make that, you will need to desulfurize Sulfuric Gas, so make<br/>some of that in your Distillery. Currently, you can only crack through<br/>the Chemical Reactor, so once you have the Refinery Gas grab some steam<br/>and get cracking. \n\n*Hint* You should start by making some Severely-Cracked<br/>Refinery Gas\n\n[note]Make x5 as many cells if you don't want to waste anything.[/note]<br/>"

The Large Boilers you might have looked<br/>at before, and perhaps used, change when you reach Titanium, and if you<br/>build one of those, you will get something quite different from the tiers<br/>before.\n\nTo start, most burnable items don't work here. These advanced<br/>boilers need to burn much hotter, and as such they only accept specific<br/>fuels. The fuel of interest here is one of two, who are built in a sort<br/>of chain, in a similar fashion as to how Diesel and CBD worked. There is<br/>Solid Super Fuel, and Magic Solid Super Fuel, and they are both created<br/>from some coal-like block, some binder and some liquid fuel. You can use<br/>CBD for this, but Heavy Fuel and LPG are also options.\n\nWhy go through<br/>this route, though? The answer is that this extra processing, although<br/>it is difficult to automate, creates fuel that is much more efficient than<br/>the fuels that were put into it, and this is because the advanced Large<br/>Boilers are slow burners that output Superheated Steam, instead of regular<br/>one. This also means that they will need two turbines to convert all the<br/>steam into EU, and even more if the amount produced is too much for them.<br/>If fuel efficiency is something you're looking for, you can tackle this<br/>challenge and further process your CBD into something even more powerful."

The tall structure<br/>is required for the process, because the condensation of the vapours occurs<br/>in different temperatures. And since heating is only applied at the bottom,<br/>temperature drops the higher the vapour travels. This means that compounds<br/>with higher boiling points will condense sooner and will end up lower in<br/>the column, the opposite is also applicable for compounds with low boiling<br/>points.\n\nThat said, the Distillation Tower replaces Distilleries by allowing<br/>you to collect all fractions at once, from the same amount of input. This<br/>means that the tower is both more efficient, and also allows automation<br/>of all the outputs at the same time, but this comes at a cost: the controller<br/>needs EV circuits, which require a built Cleanroom, and the structure blocks<br/>are mostly made of Stainless Steel. Not only that, but the tower's height<br/>depends on the recipe, since each output needs its own height level to<br/>successfully be extracted. A max-height, 12-block tall DT can cost almost<br/>a dozen stacks of stainless to build, a very expensive multi for the tier.\n\nInstead<br/>of doing that, the first DT you should build is a 5-block tall one, to<br/>distill the Oil you're pumping out of reservoirs.

They'll pile up in the tanks or output hatches, and the Distillation<br/>Tower stop when it filles, unless you enable fluid voiding in the controller<br/>- in which case everything that cannot be output will just be voided instead,<br/>and it's in your best interest to avoid this waste. What do, then?\n\nFirst<br/>off, it's important to note that almost everything you get from Oil can<br/>be processed into even more things. Whether or not the step is worthwhile<br/>is a different story altogether. That said, you're free to look through<br/>NEI or the spreadsheet to decide what you want to do, and how you want<br/>to do it. The charm of a processing chain like this is that it lets you<br/>choose your own path and gives you the information to know how to best<br/>utilize it.\n\nSecond off, Oil is a major source of byproducts, many of which<br/>are needed to create various important materials. However, this isn't the<br/>only way to obtain most of them, and you might already found other sources,<br/>especially if you've dabbled in the Benzene or the Biomass chains. Which<br/>path you take is up to you.\n\nNow, for the four fractions that you get from<br/>regular Oil. Up until now, the power generation needed both Light Fuel<br/>and Heavy Fuel processing, and Refinery Gas already proved to be a good<br/>source of Ethylene. What can these be used for, in case you can build more<br/>DTs to process the cracked fluids? Roughly speaking, these are the possibilities:\n\nLight<br/>Fuel: You will most likely be using most, or all of this to make Diesel.<br/>If you do have leftovers, moderately hydrocracking it is a good source<br/>of Propene, and lightly hydrocracking is the best source for Octane. These<br/>two are important, but only in EV, for epoxy and powergen, specifically.\n\nHeavy<br/>Fuel: If only working with regular Oil, a lot of this will also be consumed<br/>to make Diesel. However, it's important to get more of it automated, since<br/>it can be distilled directly to make three fantastic byproducts: Toluene,<br/>Phenol and Benzene. All of them are important for progression, so make<br/>sure you pay attention to this recipe. Toluene is especially useful in<br/>HV, as you will need many buckets of it when making your first rocket to<br/>be able to get into EV.\n\nNaphtha: You could distill it in a Distillation<br/>Tower, but keep in mind that you need to build a max-height one to cover<br/>the entire recipe. However, if you do it, you will have most of the Oil<br/>byproducts automated meaning that it's worth it to tackle this challenge<br/>when you get comfortable with making lots of Stainless Steel; it also has<br/>a good burn value, so if you don't need these byproducts, best just use<br/>it for power.\n\nRefinery Gas: You're probably already distilling this for<br/>Ethylene. You could switch this recipe to a Distillation Tower and a Oil<br/>Cracking Unit (see next quest) to gain more output and some useful byproducts.<br/><br/>"

Luckily for you, such an option<br/>exists and it will be presented after this quest. For now, though, you<br/>can focus on automating Nitrous Oxide by mixing Nitrogen with Oxygen. These<br/>are the two main products of distilling air, so you can obtain them in<br/>one step, but you probably have chosen your source of these gases at this"
