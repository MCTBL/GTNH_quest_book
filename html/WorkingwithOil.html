This means that each portion has<br/>6 different cracking options, and the products of distilling<br/>them can be cracked once more! There are a lot of options<br/>here, but a few of them stand out for their usefulness.\n\nThe<br/>first one you should try is Refinery Gas.

The fuel of interest here is one of two, who<br/>are built in a sort of chain, in a similar fashion<br/>as to how Diesel and CBD worked.

You can use CBD for this, but Heavy<br/>Fuel and LPG are also options.\n\nWhy go through this<br/>route, though? The answer is that this extra processing,<br/>although it is difficult to automate, creates fuel<br/>that is much more efficient than the fuels that were<br/>put into it, and this is because the advanced Large<br/>Boilers are slow burners that output Superheated Steam,<br/>instead of regular one.

What do, then?\n\nFirst<br/>off, it's important to note that almost everything<br/>you get from Oil can be processed into even more things.<br/>Whether or not the step is worthwhile is a different<br/>story altogether. That said, you're free to look through<br/>NEI or the spreadsheet to decide what you want to do,<br/>and how you want to do it. The charm of a processing<br/>chain like this is that it lets you choose your own<br/>path and gives you the information to know how to best<br/>utilize it.\n\nSecond off, Oil is a major source of byproducts,<br/>many of which are needed to create various important<br/>materials. However, this isn't the only way to obtain<br/>most of them, and you might already found other sources,<br/>especially if you've dabbled in the Benzene or the<br/>Biomass chains. Which path you take is up to you.\n\nNow,<br/>for the four fractions that you get from regular Oil.<br/>Up until now, the power generation needed both Light<br/>Fuel and Heavy Fuel processing, and Refinery Gas already<br/>proved to be a good source of Ethylene. What can these<br/>be used for, in case you can build more DTs to process<br/>the cracked fluids? Roughly speaking, these are the<br/>possibilities:\n\nLight Fuel: You will most likely be<br/>using most, or all of this to make Diesel. If you do<br/>have leftovers, moderately hydrocracking it is a good<br/>source of Propene, and lightly hydrocracking is the<br/>best source for Octane. These two are important, but<br/>only in EV, for epoxy and powergen, specifically.\n\nHeavy<br/>Fuel: If only working with regular Oil, a lot of this<br/>will also be consumed to make Diesel. However, it's<br/>important to get more of it automated, since it can<br/>be distilled directly to make three fantastic byproducts:<br/>Toluene, Phenol and Benzene. All of them are important<br/>for progression, so make sure you pay attention to<br/>this recipe. Toluene is especially useful in HV, as<br/>you will need many buckets of it when making your first<br/>rocket to be able to get into EV.\n\nNaphtha: You could<br/>distill it in a Distillation Tower, but keep in mind<br/>that you need to build a max-height one to cover the<br/>entire recipe. However, if you do it, you will have<br/>most of the Oil byproducts automated meaning that it's<br/>worth it to tackle this challenge when you get comfortable<br/>with making lots of Stainless Steel; it also has a<br/>good burn value, so if you don't need these byproducts,<br/>best just use it for power.\n\nRefinery Gas: You're probably<br/>already distilling this for Ethylene. You could switch<br/>this recipe to a Distillation Tower and a Oil Cracking<br/>Unit (see next quest) to gain more output and some<br/>useful byproducts.<br/><br/><br/>"
