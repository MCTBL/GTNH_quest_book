While you can use AE2FC without Fluid<br/>Discretizer for moving fluids, you need a Discretizer for autocrafting.\n\nThen<br/>you also need a Fluid Terminal or a Fluid Processing Terminal for the Assembly<br/>Line. \n\nWhen creating patterns you will notice your fluids being placed<br/>as if they were items. \nYour finished patterns will look blue-ish. Placing<br/>those in a Dual Interface will allow AE2 to push the fluids and items both.<br/>Note. Fluids are being sent first, then items.\nYou can switch the dual<br/>interface on the top right if you want it to keep fluids in stock. \n\nIf<br/>you use a blue pattern (fluid pattern) in a normal interface, AE2 will<br/>send the fluid as a fluid packet. This is just a representation of the<br/>fluid as an item. A fluid decoder can turn it back into a fluid and saves<br/>it in the fluid grid.\n\nYou can use an ingredient buffer (large or normal)<br/>so your items and fluids sent by a pattern can get stored internally in<br/>one block. The normal buffer can hold 9 items and 4 fluids whereas the<br/>large one can hold 27 items and 7 fluids. It is not needed, but you can<br/>use it to automate things with item and fluid conduits. \n\nIf you want to<br/>automate single blocks its as easy as eating chocolate cake while on a<br/>diet:\nMake the pattern, make an interface, boom- done! It will automatically<br/>insert the fluid in the fluid inventory of a single block machine. \n\nEven<br/>automating more difficult things like the Assembly Line becomes much easier<br/>with these tools.\n\nIf you need more detailled information, visit the wiki:\n\n[url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/AE2FC[/url]\n\n[note]The<br/>Extra Cells mod has been removed.
