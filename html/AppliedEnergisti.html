While you can use<br/>AE2FC without Fluid Discretizer for moving fluids,<br/>you need a Discretizer for autocrafting.\n\nThen you<br/>also need a Fluid Terminal or a Fluid Processing Terminal<br/>for the Assembly Line. \n\nWhen creating patterns you<br/>will notice your fluids being placed as if they were<br/>items. \nYour finished patterns will look blue-ish.<br/>Placing those in a Dual Interface will allow AE2 to<br/>push the fluids and items both. Note. Fluids are being<br/>sent first, then items.\nYou can switch the dual interface<br/>on the top right if you want it to keep fluids in stock.<br/>\n\nIf you use a blue pattern (fluid pattern) in a normal<br/>interface, AE2 will send the fluid as a fluid packet.<br/>This is just a representation of the fluid as an item.<br/>A fluid decoder can turn it back into a fluid and saves<br/>it in the fluid grid.\n\nYou can use an ingredient buffer<br/>(large or normal) so your items and fluids sent by<br/>a pattern can get stored internally in one block. The<br/>normal buffer can hold 9 items and 4 fluids whereas<br/>the large one can hold 27 items and 7 fluids. It is<br/>not needed, but you can use it to automate things with<br/>item and fluid conduits. \n\nIf you want to automate<br/>single blocks its as easy as eating chocolate cake<br/>while on a diet:\nMake the pattern, make an interface,<br/>boom- done! It will automatically insert the fluid<br/>in the fluid inventory of a single block machine. \n\nEven<br/>automating more difficult things like the Assembly<br/>Line becomes much easier with these tools.\n\nIf you<br/>need more detailled information, visit the wiki:\n\n[url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/AE2FC[/url]\n\n[note]The<br/>Extra Cells mod has been removed.

P2P connections cannot be nested, but one<br/>transport cable can carry multiple P2P connections.<br/>For a normal fluix cable, that's 4 P2P connections,<br/>and 16 for dense.\n\nYou can use separate cables to connect<br/>input p2ps to the controller and to transport from<br/>the controller to around your base, allowing for 32<br/>output p2ps on one dense cable. Alternatively you can<br/>use an entirely separate controller as a transport<br/>network.\n\nGenerally, you'll want to have the first<br/>point be one side of an ME Controller block (remember<br/>you can add more!), and the other where some of your<br/>machines are.\n\nA nice online guide can be found at<br/>[url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Applied_Energistics_2[/url]<br/>under P2P tunnels.\n\nIf you want to use one of the P2P<br/>tunnels for something \u00a7oother\u00a7r than ME channels, use<br/>an applicable item on the center of the face of the<br/>tunnel, (for example, a GT cable for GT EU, redstone<br/>for RS signal, an RF conduit for RF, a torch for light,<br/>a bucket for fluid, a chest for items, or an OC cable<br/>for OC) and it will convert to that type, even if you<br/>pick it up. Use a fluix cable to change it back.<br/>"
