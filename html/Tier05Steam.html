Also, sending<br/>a higher voltage than a machine's tier causes an explosion. Or several,<br/>if you pack things together, like many people. Sending more amps than a<br/>machine can use doesn't harm anything though.\n\nSending too high a voltage<br/>or too many amps down a cable will cause the cable to burn up and start<br/>fires, which may then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number of<br/>amps provided by generators and buffers to a cable does not exceed the<br/>amps it is capable of carrying.\n\nA generator that supplies 1A can possibly<br/>feed multiple machines, if their recipes require less than the full voltage.<br/> For example, macerators processing ore only need 2 EU/t, so you could<br/>run several from a single 1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too<br/>long. Why does that matter? Because there's loss for every amp for every<br/>block, listed on the wire/cable. Note that cables are better than wires.<br/>But be careful! Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect,<br/>like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.\n\nMost machines only use 1A,<br/>however there are exceptions, such as the arc furnace, thermal centrifuge,<br/>world accelerators, and the UUM machines. Note that machines can accept<br/>more amps than they use (usually 2) in order to top up their energy supply,<br/>especially if they didn't recieve most of the amp because of loss (mostly<br/>a problem in LV). The formula is (EU/t of Recipe * 2) / Voltage Tier +<br/>1. Keep this in mind when deciding on cables.\n\nSome machines are specifically<br/>there to help you deal with multiple amps, such as battery buffers, transformers,<br/>and diodes. Check out the quest tab Storing and Transforming EU for more<br/>on those.\n\nIf you want to send more amps, use a larger cable or a superconductor<br/>(MV+, but ULV and LV have their own lossless cables). You can use laser<br/>hatches much later to send even more. There even are wireless options,<br/>but not right now.\n\nA single block machine starved of EU will restart progress<br/>but not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will lose the items.\n\nNote<br/>that any block that emits EU has loss when doing so: 2 ^ (tier-1) per amp.<br/>So 1 EU at LV, 2 EU at MV, and so on. Using large numbers of battery buffers<br/>in a row is thus very wasteful of your power. You have to be careful with<br/>losses when making your first EBF later in LV, maybe rather power them<br/>directly? Of course, if you want to keep your amps topped up over longer<br/>distances, you'll need to place BBs occasionally to 'top up' the amps,<br/>though this is less the case the further ingame you get, as the loss becomes<br/>less of something to worry about.\n\nIf this info isn't enough for you, head<br/>on over to [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Electricity[/url] to<br/>read more.<br/>"
