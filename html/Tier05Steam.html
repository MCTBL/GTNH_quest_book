Fires next<br/>to a machine have a random chance of an explosion.<br/>Also, sending a higher voltage than a machine's tier<br/>causes an explosion. Or several, if you pack things<br/>together, like many people. Sending more amps than<br/>a machine can use doesn't harm anything though.\n\nSending<br/>too high a voltage or too many amps down a cable will<br/>cause the cable to burn up and start fires, which may<br/>then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number<br/>of amps provided by generators and buffers to a cable<br/>does not exceed the amps it is capable of carrying.\n\nA<br/>generator that supplies 1A can possibly feed multiple<br/>machines, if their recipes require less than the full<br/>voltage.  For example, macerators processing ore only<br/>need 2 EU/t, so you could run several from a single<br/>1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too long.<br/>Why does that matter? Because there's loss for every<br/>amp for every block, listed on the wire/cable. Note<br/>that cables are better than wires. But be careful!<br/>Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect,<br/>like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.\n\nMost<br/>machines only use 1A, however there are exceptions,<br/>such as the arc furnace, thermal centrifuge, world<br/>accelerators, and the UUM machines. Note that machines<br/>can accept more amps than they use (usually 2) in order<br/>to top up their energy supply, especially if they didn't<br/>recieve most of the amp because of loss (mostly a problem<br/>in LV). The formula is (EU/t of Recipe * 2) / Voltage<br/>Tier + 1. Keep this in mind when deciding on cables.\n\nSome<br/>machines are specifically there to help you deal with<br/>multiple amps, such as battery buffers, transformers,<br/>and diodes. Check out the quest tab Storing and Transforming<br/>EU for more on those.\n\nIf you want to send more amps,<br/>use a larger cable or a superconductor (MV+, but ULV<br/>and LV have their own lossless cables). You can use<br/>laser hatches much later to send even more. There even<br/>are wireless options, but not right now.\n\nA single<br/>block machine starved of EU will restart progress but<br/>not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will<br/>lose the items.\n\nNote that any block that emits EU<br/>has loss when doing so: 2 ^ (tier-1) per amp. So 1<br/>EU at LV, 2 EU at MV, and so on. Using large numbers<br/>of battery buffers in a row is thus very wasteful of<br/>your power. You have to be careful with losses when<br/>making your first EBF later in LV, maybe rather power<br/>them directly? Of course, if you want to keep your<br/>amps topped up over longer distances, you'll need to<br/>place BBs occasionally to 'top up' the amps, though<br/>this is less the case the further ingame you get, as<br/>the loss becomes less of something to worry about.\n\nIf<br/>this info isn't enough for you, head on over to [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Electricity[/url]<br/>to read more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"
