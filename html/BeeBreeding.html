                    "tooltip": "First off, don't be scared by the massive amounts of<br/>bees you see here once you unlock the breeding trees.<br/>There's even more that aren't included and you'll need<br/>NEI to find!\n\nHa ha, just kidding - don't panic! The<br/>breeding lines unlock bit by bit showing you what you<br/>can go for next, mostly from the top to the bottom.<br/>The large icons represent particularly powerful bees.<br/>Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options,<br/>only one is shown on the Bee Breeding Tree.\n\nBees have<br/>two sets of traits, active and inactive. The active<br/>one affects the behaviour of the bee while the inactive<br/>one is only relevant for breeding. \n\nA trait can be<br/>[warn]Dominant[/warn] or \u00a79Recessive\u00a7r. When getting<br/>newly bred princesses and drones, check both sets in<br/>case you got the desired traits. You can breed the<br/>ones with inactive traits to try and make them active<br/>in later crosses. A Field Kit or GT scanner cannot<br/>see passive traits, you need a Beealyzer for that.<br/>\n\nWhen breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon<br/>a master template bee - a bee that has little to no<br/>crossbreeding potential but has all the traits you<br/>want - short life, nocturnal, cave dwelling, rain tolerant,<br/>humidity tolerance, temperature tolerance, 4xfertility,<br/>and so on. Once you have that bee, breed a bunch of<br/>pure princesses with those traits as both active and<br/>inactive. These will be your breeding stock.\n\nWhen<br/>you are trying to get new species, what you want is<br/>a drone - this way you can use your \"breeding stock\"<br/>princess with the drone to get new species without<br/>the annoying effects or limitations. Poorly crossed<br/>princesses can be returned to normal by crossing with<br/>breeding stock drones, or just thrown into storage<br/>if they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you<br/>keep the trait and species you want, and slowly merge<br/>the good traits from your breeding stock. You don't<br/>have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee<br/>House to swap around traits. Remember that no species<br/>mutations occur in a Bee House. Ignoble bees are good<br/>to swap traits because they're mostly disposable -<br/>they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles,<br/>increasing slightly more each generation after that,<br/>though genetic stability frames can let them live longer.<br/>\n\nOnce you solidify your species, create a pool of<br/>drones. You can use those to convert pristine princesses<br/>to the new species. Pristine princesses will not die,<br/>but they can become Ignoble under certain circumstances<br/>like using tons of production frames. Rocky bees are<br/>a great source - all their princesses are always pristine,<br/>they have decent traits, and there's a bunch of them<br/>underground. If you have an ender quarry, you can collect<br/>them with that.\n\nOnce you get a new species, it will<br/>replace either all Active or Inactive traits. If the<br/>mutation happens twice at the same bee, it will replace<br/>both sets. For example, when you get a Cultivated bee,<br/>either the Active or Inactive column will have all<br/>the default Cultivated traits. Mix it a few times and<br/>you'll eventually get purebred versions. Just watch<br/>out that you don't lose a key trait, like Fast Worker<br/>for Cultivated. Most effects are useless, so you can<br/>disregard them.\n\nAll quests require purebred species.<br/>Purebred means that the inactive species-trait is the<br/>same as the active one.\n\nAll traits can be bred into<br/>any bee species, aside from the species itself. Species<br/>also determines the preferred temperature and humidity,<br/>as well as drops. Species require their preferred temperature<br/>and humidity to be in the 'jubilant' state and produce<br/>their special drops. You can also mimic this with the<br/>alveary or industrial apiary, but NOT with tolerances.\n\nAdvanced<br/>frames can provide useful boosts to mutation chances<br/>or lifespan reduction for faster breeding cycles. However,<br/>the excessive multipliers will increase genetic decay,<br/>giving a chance for a pristine princess to become ignoble.\n\nIt<br/>looks complex, because it is! But it's also a lot of<br/>dangerous and useful fun!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"
