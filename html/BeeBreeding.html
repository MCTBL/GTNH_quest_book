                    "tooltip": "First off, don't be scared by the massive amounts of bees you see here<br/>once you unlock the breeding trees. There's even more that aren't included<br/>and you'll need NEI to find!\n\nHa ha, just kidding - don't panic! The breeding<br/>lines unlock bit by bit showing you what you can go for next, mostly from<br/>the top to the bottom. The large icons represent particularly powerful<br/>bees. Many of the basic bees have multiple breeding options, only one is<br/>shown on the Bee Breeding Tree.\n\nBees have two sets of traits, active and<br/>inactive. The active one affects the behaviour of the bee while the inactive<br/>one is only relevant for breeding. \n\nA trait can be [warn]Dominant[/warn]<br/>or Recessive. When getting newly bred princesses and drones, check both<br/>sets in case you got the desired traits. You can breed the ones with inactive<br/>traits to try and make them active in later crosses. A Field Kit or GT<br/>scanner cannot see passive traits, you need a Beealyzer for that. \n\nWhen<br/>breeding bees, a good idea is to settle upon a master template bee - a<br/>bee that has little to no crossbreeding potential but has all the traits<br/>you want - short life, nocturnal, cave dwelling, rain tolerant, humidity<br/>tolerance, temperature tolerance, 4xfertility, and so on. Once you have<br/>that bee, breed a bunch of pure princesses with those traits as both active<br/>and inactive. These will be your breeding stock.\n\nWhen you are trying to<br/>get new species, what you want is a drone - this way you can use your \"breeding<br/>stock\" princess with the drone to get new species without the annoying<br/>effects or limitations. Poorly crossed princesses can be returned to normal<br/>by crossing with breeding stock drones, or just thrown into storage if<br/>they now have annoying restrictions. Make sure you keep the trait and species<br/>you want, and slowly merge the good traits from your breeding stock. You<br/>don't have to do this part in an Apiary, you can use a Bee House to swap<br/>around traits. Remember that no species mutations occur in a Bee House.<br/>Ignoble bees are good to swap traits because they're mostly disposable<br/>- they have a chance to die after 100 breeding cycles, increasing slightly<br/>more each generation after that, though genetic stability frames can let<br/>them live longer. \n\nOnce you solidify your species, create a pool of drones.<br/>You can use those to convert pristine princesses to the new species. Pristine<br/>princesses will not die, but they can become Ignoble under certain circumstances<br/>like using tons of production frames. Rocky bees are a great source - all<br/>their princesses are always pristine, they have decent traits, and there's<br/>a bunch of them underground. If you have an ender quarry, you can collect<br/>them with that.\n\nOnce you get a new species, it will replace either all<br/>Active or Inactive traits. If the mutation happens twice at the same bee,<br/>it will replace both sets. For example, when you get a Cultivated bee,<br/>either the Active or Inactive column will have all the default Cultivated<br/>traits. Mix it a few times and you'll eventually get purebred versions.<br/>Just watch out that you don't lose a key trait, like Fast Worker for Cultivated.<br/>Most effects are useless, so you can disregard them.\n\nAll quests require<br/>purebred species. Purebred means that the inactive species-trait is the<br/>same as the active one.\n\nAll traits can be bred into any bee species, aside<br/>from the species itself. Species also determines the preferred temperature<br/>and humidity, as well as drops. Species require their preferred temperature<br/>and humidity to be in the 'jubilant' state and produce their special drops.<br/>You can also mimic this with the alveary or industrial apiary, but NOT<br/>with tolerances.\n\nAdvanced frames can provide useful boosts to mutation<br/>chances or lifespan reduction for faster breeding cycles. However, the<br/>excessive multipliers will increase genetic decay, giving a chance for<br/>a pristine princess to become ignoble.\n\nIt looks complex, because it is!<br/>But it's also a lot of dangerous and useful fun!<br/><br/>"
