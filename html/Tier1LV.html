This one doesn't explode the user too on use.<br/>Features! There are four types of oil or natural gas for the overworld.<br/>See the quest in Tips and Tricks once you've made an oil drill.\n\n1) Right<br/>click explosives.\n2) Use a single Data Stick to extract the data by right<br/>clicking on it after the animation has finished. Each will hold ONE result.\n3)<br/>Next you need to put the data stick in a GT scanner to have it analyzed.\n4)<br/>Place the analyzed data stick in the bottom right slot of a printer and<br/>add 3 paper in the top left slot and make sure you have at least 144L squid<br/>ink in it.\n5) Take the printed pages and combine it with a piece of leather<br/>in an assembling machine filled with at least 20 mb of refined glue.\n\n[note]TADA![/note]<br/>Now you have a book with detailed info about the chunks you scanned. Visual<br/>Prospecting adds the information to your map the moment you make the book.\n\nData<br/>Sticks are not easy (or possible) to make right now, so do not lose them.<br/>You can put it in a crafting table to erase it when done.\n\nOre locations<br/>are given as the center of the chunk. Ores that are marginal in that chunk<br/>may not be found in the center but on an edge. Look at where ores are located<br/>and determine the center of the vein. At higher tiers, it scans more chunks<br/>for ores. If you just want to know about fluids, use the lower tier version<br/>so the book isn't as long.\n\nEach underground fluid field is 8x8 chunks.<br/>This starts at 0,0 and continues for 8 chunks east and south, containing<br/>64 chunks. Not all fields have anything in them though. Within the field<br/>the amount can vary +/- 25 percent.

The prospector<br/>reports on 3x3 fields (as in, 9 fields of 8x8 chunks) at all tiers with<br/>the center field where the seismic prospector is located.

Check<br/>the EBF quest in the Multiblock Goals.\n\nYou will also need an EBF to turn<br/>the alumina into aluminium ingots. For that you need cryolite.

The related quest<br/>is \"Lead, Galena, Silver and Cryolite\" is the Novice Thaumaturgy tab.\n\nYour<br/>second option is to use aluminium dust. However, you can not smelt that<br/>directly yet, even if you have an EBF. That will require higher heat levels.<br/>For now, you will have to either use a Tinker's Smeltery or a GT Compressor<br/>to turn the dust into raw aluminium which you can then smelt into ingots<br/>in the EBF.

Thanks to the advancement of technology the pump can auto output<br/>on top. Stacking multiple pumps makes them work faster. In that case, oil<br/>has to be removed from the bottom of the stack using a pump cover or other<br/>means like a conduit.\n\nTaller spouts have more oil.

Save the<br/>taller spouts for MV or HV pumps.\n\nMining pipes are needed for pumping<br/>the oil, same as the auto miner. When it hits the bottom (or something<br/>in the way), if there's no fluid left to collect, it will start retracting<br/>the pipes. Same thing if you disable it with a soft mallet.

Inbetween<br/>use the associated pipe blocks - the total distance between endpoints must<br/>be more than 64 blocks apart (4 or more chunks). There can only be one<br/>start and end point per pipeline.\n\nTo actually connect it, you need to<br/>align the start LDIP block such that the arrows are facing inwards, and<br/>the opposite side of it has a LDIPP block. Put a conveyor on the side of<br/>the block that has the arrows and set to import. It will now attempt to<br/>import stuff to the endpoint LDIP. This will go as fast as you can put<br/>items into it.\n\nDo the opposite on the far side, except you don't need<br/>a conveyor.\n\nNow you only need to chunkload the start and end points and<br/>the items will be \"teleported\" to you.\n\nOf course, later on you'll probably<br/>use ender chests to actually teleport the ore, especially from other dims.\n\nThis<br/>setup is lag-free in the pipe blocks, so it's useful in your base as well<br/>if you want to reduce lag."
