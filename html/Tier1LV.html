A seismic prospector<br/>will tell you the ores in the surrounding chunks in<br/>a (sorta) handy book you can read, and also the underground<br/>fluids beneath you. It doesn't need to be powered.\n\nTo<br/>determine which kind of fluid there is in the chunk<br/>you need to scan the soil by right clicking an Advanced<br/>Seismic Prospector with 2 Powderbarrels, 4 Glyceryl<br/>Trinitate cells, 8 iTNT or 16 TNT. This one doesn't<br/>explode the user too on use. Features! There are four<br/>types of oil or natural gas for the overworld. See<br/>the quest in Tips and Tricks once you've made an oil<br/>drill.\n\n1) Right click explosives.\n2) Use a single<br/>Data Stick to extract the data by right clicking on<br/>it after the animation has finished. Each will hold<br/>ONE result.\n3) Next you need to put the data stick<br/>in a GT scanner to have it analyzed.\n4) Place the analyzed<br/>data stick in the bottom right slot of a printer and<br/>add 3 paper in the top left slot and make sure you<br/>have at least 144L squid ink in it.\n5) Take the printed<br/>pages and combine it with a piece of leather in an<br/>assembling machine filled with at least 20 mb of refined<br/>glue.\n\n[note]TADA![/note] Now you have a book with<br/>detailed info about the chunks you scanned. Visual<br/>Prospecting adds the information to your map the moment<br/>you make the book.\n\n\u00a72Data Sticks are not easy (or<br/>possible) to make right now, so do not lose them.\u00a7r<br/>You can put it in a crafting table to erase it when<br/>done.\n\nOre locations are given as the center of the<br/>chunk. Ores that are marginal in that chunk may not<br/>be found in the center but on an edge. Look at where<br/>ores are located and determine the center of the vein.<br/>At higher tiers, it scans more chunks for ores. If<br/>you just want to know about fluids, use the lower tier<br/>version so the book isn't as long.\n\nEach underground<br/>fluid field is 8x8 chunks. This starts at 0,0 and continues<br/>for 8 chunks east and south, containing 64 chunks.<br/>Not all fields have anything in them though. Within<br/>the field the amount can vary +/- 25 percent. The amount<br/>reported in the book is the minimum and maximum per<br/>field across all chunks in the field. The prospector<br/>reports on 3x3 fields (as in, 9 fields of 8x8 chunks)<br/>at all tiers with the center field where the seismic<br/>prospector is located. Fluid extraction rate depends<br/>on many factors, check the wiki for details. In general,<br/>anything above 300 is really good. The total amount<br/>in the chunk is complicated. \n\n<br/><br/>"
