After 10 seconds of flight, the pearl is automatically<br/>destroyed without any teleportation or fall damage.\n\nIncreased range (String)\nUnlike<br/>the no gravity effect, the pearl will fall down due to gravity, but will<br/>do so 25% slower.

Just as with the explosive effect,<br/>this will not affect the thrower unless they throw the pearl close to them,<br/>or have the riding effect applied. This effect is also followed by ice<br/>cracking sound and snow particles.\n\nRiding (Lead)\nThe thrower will \"ride\"<br/>the pearl to its destination. During the ride, if another pearl with this<br/>effect is thrown, the previous pearl will destroy itself and deal fall<br/>damage (unless No fall damage effect is applied).\n\nTrivia:\nThe Enhanced<br/>Ender Pearls can still be used for crafting an Eye of Ender.<br/><br/>"

When the ore is mined with<br/>an Advanced Pickaxe, it has a chance to drop 0-4 pieces of Stardust. Even<br/>though this ore comes in clusters, two ore blocks from the same cluster<br/>can be generated away from each other, making Stardust Ore a rare resource<br/>which requires thorough exploration and mining.\n\nStardust Ore block has<br/>different textures on its sides.\n\nSphalerite: You can macerate it for crushed<br/>normal sphalerite,"
