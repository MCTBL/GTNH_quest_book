After 10 seconds<br/>of flight, the pearl is automatically destroyed without<br/>any teleportation or fall damage.\n\nIncreased range<br/>(String)\nUnlike the no gravity effect, the pearl will<br/>fall down due to gravity, but will do so 25% slower.<br/>If the pearl has the no gravity effect too, it will<br/>override this effect.\n\nDouble speed (Gold Nugget)\nIncreases<br/>the pearl's speed by a factor of 2, but won't change<br/>the flight trajectory. This can be helpful if you are<br/>in a bad situation (fell in lava, swarm of mobs around...)<br/>and need to be saved very quickly. In combination with<br/>the riding effect, you may notice slight stuttering<br/>on a server.\n\nExplosive (Gunpowder)\nUpon landing, the<br/>pearl will explode with radius of 2.7 (TNT has radius<br/>of 4). This will not harm the thrower as long as they<br/>are far enough from the landing spot.\n\nFreeze (Snowball)<br/>\nThe pearl will freeze mobs and players within 5 blocks<br/>of the landing spot for at least 4 seconds. Just as<br/>with the explosive effect, this will not affect the<br/>thrower unless they throw the pearl close to them,<br/>or have the riding effect applied. This effect is also<br/>followed by ice cracking sound and snow particles.\n\nRiding<br/>(Lead)\nThe thrower will \"ride\" the pearl to its destination.<br/>During the ride, if another pearl with this effect<br/>is thrown, the previous pearl will destroy itself and<br/>deal fall damage (unless No fall damage effect is applied).\n\nTrivia:\nThe<br/>Enhanced Ender Pearls can still be used for crafting<br/>an Eye of Ender.<br/><br/><br/>"
