[warn]Always test in Creative first![/warn]\n\nWhen using turbines,<br/>be careful of flow rates. To find the optimal flow rate, you divide the<br/>optimal energy flow rate listed on the turbine, by the energy value for<br/>the plasma. You can also use the Large Turbine Calculator (there's a link<br/>on the main spreadsheet, which is linked to in discord), or scan the multiblock's<br/>controller while feeding it a minimal amount of plasma to see what the<br/>optimal flow is. Make sure to use a Fluid Regulator set to this flow rate<br/>for highest fuel efficiency, or go beyond it to get more EU/t at a cost<br/>to efficiency, with Plasma Turbines being the best at retaining efficiency<br/>beyond the optimal flow.\n\nIf you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get<br/>a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value<br/>depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this<br/>type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 250% of optimal flow to produce<br/>158% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 400% of optimal flow to produce<br/>214% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 550% of optimal flow to<br/>produce 301% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more<br/>fuel efficiency you're throwing away.\n\nThe choice is yours!\n\n[note]For<br/>a lot of extra information on fusion, check out the new quest line called<br/>Powerful Nuclear Physics.[/note]"
