Fusion can reach levels close<br/>to eight times that with the right setup. \n\nFor your<br/>first reactor, you will need a controller, 2-16 fluid<br/>input hatches, 1-16 fluid output hatches, and 16 energy<br/>hatches. All hatches have to be LuV tier or better.<br/>Each hatch provides 2048 EU/t for the recipe, and has<br/>a storage capacity of 10M eu. \n\nThis means you can<br/>do any fusion recipe that takes less than 32768 EU/t<br/>or less, and has a startup cost of 160M EU or less.<br/>Using more fluid hatches means you need less fusion<br/>casings.
