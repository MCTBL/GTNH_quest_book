And store energy that way. Simply construct a dam and flood vast<br/>areas with water. You may add energy to your storage by pumping more water<br/>into it or just drain it back into energy whenever you need. This works<br/>especially well with fluctuating energy sources like wind, water, and solar.<br/>Or you dump excess energy into it so you can use it another time. The capacity<br/>is huge and the choice is yours.\n\nSounds great! But...? - Indeed. There<br/>is a catch: Pumps and Turbines will have efficiency correlated loss. Still<br/>interested? Let's get to crafting!\n\nThe multi-block has an unusual shape:<br/>the back is open. The lake will spawn inside the multi-block and spread<br/>block-by-block as far as it can/is allowed. It will replace plants like<br/>water (make sure to secure your IC2 Crops!) but not replace any solid blocks.<br/>Additionally, you can specify limits in any direction. The water will NEVER<br/>spread past these limits. You can set those limits in a second GUI by right<br/>clicking the controller with a screwdriver.\n\nWhen you enter a limit, it<br/>will correct itself to the nearest valid setting. Especially if you try<br/>to spread past the server limits. You may talk your admin into raising<br/>these limits (these limits are designed to limit griefing). Further, water<br/>is not able to spread into foreign towns.\nYou will also find 3 magical<br/>buttons in the top-right of this GUI. From left to right: The first will<br/>slowly despawn the lake blocks. You can use this to shrink the lake if<br/>it spread past a barrier for example. The multi-block will also initialize<br/>with this configuration so there is no accidental flooding. The second<br/>and third buttons will slowly spawn more lake blocks. Additionally, the<br/>second button will render those lake blocks pink so you see where they<br/>are so you may plug holes and such. In this \"debug\" mode you can walk/breathe/act<br/>in the lake like in air. This should make it easy to create a sunken village<br/>for decoration purposes. The third button is for normal operations so you<br/>can see the water and enjoy a swim in your energy buffer.\n\nOf course, there<br/>is also a normal GUI (simple right-click). It shows you the energy stored<br/>in the dam. To reach higher water levels you are required to use stronger<br/>pumps. For this purpose, you may configure the voltage tier of the GUI<br/>with a circuit in the circuit slot. Don't worry: It is only optical. You<br/>cannot void any energy if you set a low voltage tier. It is only for the<br/>player information. You may give it a try with the reward you earn...\n\nIf<br/>you have any further questions, find missing information, or have suggestions<br/>please do not hesitate to post on the official GT New Horizons Discord.<br/>Please add '@SinTh0r4s' to your post to make sure I\u2019ll see it.\n\n[warn]A<br/>warning though: there have been a lot of mentions of bugs and even world<br/>corruptions caused by the Hydro Dam. Use at your own risk. If you have<br/>more detailed information, please report these problems on the GTNH github.[/warn]<br/><br/>"

Also, sending<br/>a higher voltage than a machine's tier causes an explosion. Or several,<br/>if you pack things together, like many people. Sending more amps than a<br/>machine can use doesn't harm anything though.\n\nSending too high a voltage<br/>or too many amps down a cable will cause the cable to burn up and start<br/>fires, which may then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number of<br/>amps provided by generators and buffers to a cable does not exceed the<br/>amps it is capable of carrying.\n\nA generator that supplies 1A can possibly<br/>feed multiple machines, if their recipes require less than the full voltage.<br/> For example, macerators processing ore only need 2 EU/t, so you could<br/>run several from a single 1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too<br/>long. Why does that matter? Because there's loss for every amp for every<br/>block, listed on the wire/cable. Note that cables are better than wires.<br/>But be careful! Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect,<br/>like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.\n\nMost machines only use 1A,<br/>however there are exceptions, such as the arc furnace, thermal centrifuge,<br/>world accelerators, and the UUM machines. Note that machines can accept<br/>more amps than they use (usually 2) in order to top up their energy supply,<br/>especially if they didn't recieve most of the amp because of loss (mostly<br/>a problem in LV). The formula is (EU/t of Recipe * 2) / Voltage Tier +<br/>1. Keep this in mind when deciding on cables.\n\nSome machines are specifically<br/>there to help you deal with multiple amps, such as battery buffers, transformers,<br/>and diodes. Check out the quest tab Storing and Transforming EU for more<br/>on those.\n\nIf you want to send more amps, use a larger cable or a superconductor<br/>(MV+, but ULV and LV have their own lossless cables). You can use laser<br/>hatches much later to send even more. There even are wireless options,<br/>but not right now.\n\nA single block machine starved of EU will restart progress<br/>but not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will lose the items.\n\nNote<br/>that any block that emits EU has loss when doing so: 2 ^ (tier-1) per amp.<br/>So 1 EU at LV, 2 EU at MV, and so on. Using large numbers of battery buffers<br/>in a row is thus very wasteful of your power. You have to be careful with<br/>losses when making your first EBF later in LV, maybe rather power them<br/>directly? Of course, if you want to keep your amps topped up over longer<br/>distances, you'll need to place BBs occasionally to 'top up' the amps,<br/>though this is less the case the further ingame you get, as the loss becomes<br/>less of something to worry about.\n\nIf this info isn't enough for you, head<br/>on over to [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Electricity[/url] to<br/>read more.<br/>"

Are you a fan of lightning bolts zapping around your base?\n\nThen<br/>this multiblock is for you, the Telsa Tower comes with high amperage output<br/>and full TecTech energy hatch support with this powerful multiblock.\n\nTo<br/>get started you will need to fill the tower with capacitors matching the<br/>tier of the Primary Tesla Windings within the capacitor bank. The Tesla<br/>Winding determines the tier of power that the tower transfers power at<br/>and the amount of capacitors determines the maximum amperage that can be<br/>output. \n\nA total of 16 capacitors can be placed into one capacitor bank<br/>so you might need many banks depending on your power needs.\n\nOnce the tower<br/>is constructed click open the controller to configure the maximum transfer<br/>distance of the tower to fit the needs of your base. The range setting<br/>is currently buggy which means that at least for now you can do so without<br/>needing any plasmas. This option is called \u201cTesla Towers Transfer Radius<br/>Setting\u201d.\n\nNow that your tower is all configured how do you get power out<br/>of it to your machines? Well I am glad you asked. To get power to the machines<br/>of the base you will need to use the Tesla Coil Covers. Place them on your<br/>machines, energy hatches and even transformers to get power flowing from<br/>the tower. Energy hatches are a bit picky however and the hatch likes to<br/>be facing upwards to receive power.\n\n[warn]Warning! The Tesla Tower will<br/>output only one tier of amp such as EV, IV etc. When upgrading the Primary<br/>Tesla Windings, please make sure to check that all of your coil covers<br/>and transceivers in the base can handle the upgraded power. Failure to<br/>do so will result in a machine explosion.[/warn]\n\n[warn]Failure to turn<br/>off the controller before adjustment can also cause an explosion.[/warn]<br/>"
