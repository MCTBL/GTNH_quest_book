And store<br/>energy that way. Simply construct a dam and flood vast<br/>areas with water. You may add energy to your storage<br/>by pumping more water into it or just drain it back<br/>into energy whenever you need. This works especially<br/>well with fluctuating energy sources like wind, water,<br/>and solar. Or you dump excess energy into it so you<br/>can use it another time. The capacity is huge and the<br/>choice is yours.\n\nSounds great! But...? - Indeed. There<br/>is a catch: Pumps and Turbines will have efficiency<br/>correlated loss. Still interested? Let's get to crafting!\n\nThe<br/>multi-block has an unusual shape: the back is open.<br/>The lake will spawn inside the multi-block and spread<br/>block-by-block as far as it can/is allowed. It will<br/>replace plants like water (make sure to secure your<br/>IC2 Crops!) but not replace any solid blocks. Additionally,<br/>you can specify limits in any direction. The water<br/>will NEVER spread past these limits. You can set those<br/>limits in a second GUI by right clicking the controller<br/>with a screwdriver.\n\nWhen you enter a limit, it will<br/>correct itself to the nearest valid setting. Especially<br/>if you try to spread past the server limits. You may<br/>talk your admin into raising these limits (these limits<br/>are designed to limit griefing). Further, water is<br/>not able to spread into foreign towns.\nYou will also<br/>find 3 magical buttons in the top-right of this GUI.<br/>From left to right: The first will slowly despawn the<br/>lake blocks. You can use this to shrink the lake if<br/>it spread past a barrier for example. The multi-block<br/>will also initialize with this configuration so there<br/>is no accidental flooding. The second and third buttons<br/>will slowly spawn more lake blocks. Additionally, the<br/>second button will render those lake blocks pink so<br/>you see where they are so you may plug holes and such.<br/>In this \"debug\" mode you can walk/breathe/act in the<br/>lake like in air. This should make it easy to create<br/>a sunken village for decoration purposes. The third<br/>button is for normal operations so you can see the<br/>water and enjoy a swim in your energy buffer.\n\nOf course,<br/>there is also a normal GUI (simple right-click). It<br/>shows you the energy stored in the dam. To reach higher<br/>water levels you are required to use stronger pumps.<br/>For this purpose, you may configure the voltage tier<br/>of the GUI with a circuit in the circuit slot. Don't<br/>worry: It is only optical. You cannot void any energy<br/>if you set a low voltage tier. It is only for the player<br/>information. You may give it a try with the reward<br/>you earn...\n\nIf you have any further questions, find<br/>missing information, or have suggestions please do<br/>not hesitate to post on the official GT New Horizons<br/>Discord. Please add '@SinTh0r4s' to your post to make<br/>sure I\u2019ll see it.\n\n[warn]A warning though: there have<br/>been a lot of mentions of bugs and even world corruptions<br/>caused by the Hydro Dam. Use at your own risk. If you<br/>have more detailed information, please report these<br/>problems on the GTNH github.[/warn]<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Fires next<br/>to a machine have a random chance of an explosion.<br/>Also, sending a higher voltage than a machine's tier<br/>causes an explosion. Or several, if you pack things<br/>together, like many people. Sending more amps than<br/>a machine can use doesn't harm anything though.\n\nSending<br/>too high a voltage or too many amps down a cable will<br/>cause the cable to burn up and start fires, which may<br/>then cause machine explosions. Make sure the number<br/>of amps provided by generators and buffers to a cable<br/>does not exceed the amps it is capable of carrying.\n\nA<br/>generator that supplies 1A can possibly feed multiple<br/>machines, if their recipes require less than the full<br/>voltage.  For example, macerators processing ore only<br/>need 2 EU/t, so you could run several from a single<br/>1A generator, as long as the wires aren't too long.<br/>Why does that matter? Because there's loss for every<br/>amp for every block, listed on the wire/cable. Note<br/>that cables are better than wires. But be careful!<br/>Sometimes a recipe needs a lot more EU than you expect,<br/>like a macerator sand -> quartz dust recipe.\n\nMost<br/>machines only use 1A, however there are exceptions,<br/>such as the arc furnace, thermal centrifuge, world<br/>accelerators, and the UUM machines. Note that machines<br/>can accept more amps than they use (usually 2) in order<br/>to top up their energy supply, especially if they didn't<br/>recieve most of the amp because of loss (mostly a problem<br/>in LV). The formula is (EU/t of Recipe * 2) / Voltage<br/>Tier + 1. Keep this in mind when deciding on cables.\n\nSome<br/>machines are specifically there to help you deal with<br/>multiple amps, such as battery buffers, transformers,<br/>and diodes. Check out the quest tab Storing and Transforming<br/>EU for more on those.\n\nIf you want to send more amps,<br/>use a larger cable or a superconductor (MV+, but ULV<br/>and LV have their own lossless cables). You can use<br/>laser hatches much later to send even more. There even<br/>are wireless options, but not right now.\n\nA single<br/>block machine starved of EU will restart progress but<br/>not lose the recipe items. A multiblock machine will<br/>lose the items.\n\nNote that any block that emits EU<br/>has loss when doing so: 2 ^ (tier-1) per amp. So 1<br/>EU at LV, 2 EU at MV, and so on. Using large numbers<br/>of battery buffers in a row is thus very wasteful of<br/>your power. You have to be careful with losses when<br/>making your first EBF later in LV, maybe rather power<br/>them directly? Of course, if you want to keep your<br/>amps topped up over longer distances, you'll need to<br/>place BBs occasionally to 'top up' the amps, though<br/>this is less the case the further ingame you get, as<br/>the loss becomes less of something to worry about.\n\nIf<br/>this info isn't enough for you, head on over to [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Electricity[/url]<br/>to read more.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Are you tired of having to upgrade your<br/>cables constantly to handle different amperage amounts?<br/>Are you a fan of lightning bolts zapping around your<br/>base?\n\nThen this multiblock is for you, the Telsa Tower<br/>comes with high amperage output and full TecTech energy<br/>hatch support with this powerful multiblock.\n\nTo get<br/>started you will need to fill the tower with capacitors<br/>matching the tier of the Primary Tesla Windings within<br/>the capacitor bank. The Tesla Winding determines the<br/>tier of power that the tower transfers power at and<br/>the amount of capacitors determines the maximum amperage<br/>that can be output. \n\nA total of 16 capacitors can<br/>be placed into one capacitor bank so you might need<br/>many banks depending on your power needs.\n\nOnce the<br/>tower is constructed click open the controller to configure<br/>the maximum transfer distance of the tower to fit the<br/>needs of your base. The range setting is currently<br/>buggy which means that at least for now you can do<br/>so without needing any plasmas. This option is called<br/>\u201cTesla Towers Transfer Radius Setting\u201d.\n\nNow that your<br/>tower is all configured how do you get power out of<br/>it to your machines? Well I am glad you asked. To get<br/>power to the machines of the base you will need to<br/>use the Tesla Coil Covers. Place them on your machines,<br/>energy hatches and even transformers to get power flowing<br/>from the tower. Energy hatches are a bit picky however<br/>and the hatch likes to be facing upwards to receive<br/>power.\n\n[warn]Warning! The Tesla Tower will output<br/>only one tier of amp such as EV, IV etc. When upgrading<br/>the Primary Tesla Windings, please make sure to check<br/>that all of your coil covers and transceivers in the<br/>base can handle the upgraded power. Failure to do so<br/>will result in a machine explosion.[/warn]\n\n[warn]Failure<br/>to turn off the controller before adjustment can also<br/>cause an explosion.[/warn]<br/><br/>"
